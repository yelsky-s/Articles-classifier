# Articles-classifier
Classification of geological articles to sub-categories.
This project takes a pdf article from scientific journals on geology and classifies them into one of 4 subcategories: hydrology, earthquakes, tectonics or non of the above. Text processing in this script was done with NLTK library using costumised themes lists for each category: hydrology, earthquakes and tectonics. In this app the work with PDF files was done using PyPDF2 package. 

Example of a classifier outcome of an article named - Evaluation of a Ground Water Potencial using Aquifer Characteristics on Parts of Boki Area, South Eastern Nigeria -> Article 1 in this repository.
