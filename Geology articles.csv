Molybdenum isotopes in mafic igneous rocks record slabmantle interactions from subarc to postarc depths,"Arc volcanic rocks erupted above oceanic subduction zones generally have heavy molybdenum (Mo) isotopic compositions, which are attributed to contributions from oceanic slab–derived fluids with isotopically heavy Mo at subarc depths. Given that mafic igneous rocks with light Mo isotopic compositions have been rarely identified, it is unclear where light Mo isotope reservoirs reside, as these must exist due to oceanic subduction through geologic time. We present Mo isotope data from Mesozoic–Cenozoic mafic igneous rocks from the eastern North China craton, which were affected by continuous subduction of the oceanic slab. The Mesozoic mafic igneous rocks have island-arc basalt (IAB)–like features and high δ98Mo values of –0.15‰ to +0.09‰. In contrast, the Cenozoic mafic igneous rocks have ocean-island basalt (OIB)–like features and low δ98Mo values of –0.53‰ to –0.19‰. In addition, these two suites of rocks exhibit systematic differences in Sr-Nd isotopic compositions and fluid- and melt-mobile element contents, indicating that their mantle sources contained crustal components derived from different depths. The heavy Mo and weakly enriched Sr-Nd isotopic compositions and IAB-like trace-element signatures were inherited from slab fluids (including oceanic crust–derived aqueous solutions and seafloor sediment–derived hydrous melts) liberated at subarc depths. The light Mo and depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions and OIB-like trace-element signatures were inherited from dehydrated slab–derived melts (with rutile breakdown) at postarc depths. Therefore, Mo isotope systematics of mafic igneous rocks are a powerful means with which to trace the geochemical fluxes from subducting oceanic slabs to the mantle wedge at different depths.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/3/618289/Molybdenum-isotopes-in-mafic-igneous-rocks-record,2023-01-21
Calcitic shells in the aragonite sea of the earliest Cambrian,"The initial acquisition of calcium carbonate polymorphs (aragonite and calcite) at the onset of skeletal biomineralization by disparate metazoans across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition is thought to be directly influenced by Earth's seawater chemistry. It has been presumed that animal clades that first acquired mineralized skeletons during the so-called “aragonite sea” of the latest Ediacaran and earliest Cambrian (Terreneuvian) possessed aragonite or high-Mg calcite skeletons, while clades that arose in the subsequent “calcite sea” of Cambrian Series 2 acquired low-Mg calcite skeletons. Here, contrary to previous expectations, we document shells of one of the earliest helcionelloid molluscs from the basal Cambrian of southwestern Mongolia that are composed entirely of low-Mg calcite and formed during the Terreneuvian aragonite sea. The extraordinarily well-preserved Postacanthella shells have a simple prismatic microstructure identical to that of their modern low-Mg calcite molluscan relatives. High-resolution scanning electron microscope observations show that calcitic crystallites were originally encased within an intra- and interprismatic organic matrix scaffold preserved by aggregates of apatite during early diagenesis. This indicates that not all molluscan taxa during the early Cambrian produced aragonitic shells, weakening the direct link between carbonate skeletal mineralogy and ambient seawater chemistry during the early evolution of the phylum. Rather, our study suggests that skeletal mineralogy in Postacanthella was biologically controlled, possibly exerted by the associated prismatic organic matrix. The presence of calcite or aragonite mineralogy in different early Cambrian molluscan taxa indicates that the construction of calcium carbonate polymorphs at the time when skeletons first emerged may have been species dependent.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/8/618719/Calcitic-shells-in-the-aragonite-sea-of-the,2023-01-21
Impact of stream power gradients on storage of sediment and carbon on channel margins and floodplains,"Spatial complexity impacts the resilience of river ecosystems by mediating processes that control the sources and sinks of sediment and organic material. Using four independent geochemical tracers and three morphometric indices, we show that downstream spatial gradients in stream power (Ω) predict storage of material in the channels and margins and/or floodplains. A field test in a 48 km2 watershed demonstrates that reaches with downstream decreases in Ω coincide with wider floodplains and elevated inventories of 137Cs, 210Pbex (ex—excess), and organic matter in locations of the ~3 to 20 yr floodplain. In contrast, reaches with downstream increases in Ω coincide with narrower floodplains and decreased inventories of 137Cs, 210Pbex, and organic matter. The occurrence of in-channel bedrock exposures and the activity of short-lived 7Be in within-channel sediments also correlate with downstream Ω gradients, demonstrating a link, over both short and long time scales, between withinchannel processes and floodplain-forming processes. The combined geochemical and physical characteristics demonstrate the importance of downstream gradients in sediment transport, characterized by downstream changes in stream power rather than at-a-point stream power, in determining spatial complexity in carbon and sediment storage at intermediate scales (102 to 103 m) in river systems.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/13/618720/Impact-of-stream-power-gradients-on-storage-of,2023-01-21

Resetting of zircon inclusions in garnet: Implications for elastic thermobarometry,"Elastic thermobarometry of host-inclusion systems for back-calculating pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions of inclusion entrapment relies on the assumption that the hostinclusion rheology is purely elastic. In this study, we have explored both the elastic and non-elastic behavior of zircon-in-garnet (ZiG) systems by in situ Raman spectroscopy at high T and ambient P. We show that upon heating, plastic relaxation takes place immediately after the zircon inclusions experience tensile stress conditions with respect to a free crystal at the same T. On subsequent cooling, the inclusions develop a new stress state, and thus the inclusion pressures have been reset from those corresponding to their original entrapment. Resetting of inclusion pressures therefore strongly depends on the exhumation P-T path. This explains why elastic thermobarometry using ZiG systems is reliable when applied to low-P high-T rocks where the cooling path after inclusion entrapment passes quickly into the compression domain of the inclusion. On the other hand, high-P rocks exhumed along quasi-isothermal paths take zircon inclusions into the tensile domain where they are reset until significant cooling commences at low P. ZiG systems in ultrahigh-P rocks therefore commonly indicate pressures on clockwise exhumation paths instead of the conditions of original entrapment.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/23/618749/Resetting-of-zircon-inclusions-in-garnet,2023-01-21
Rapid megaflood-triggered base-level rise on Mars,"The existence of ancient fluvial systems on Mars is widely accepted, but little is known about how quickly they formed, or what environmental conditions controlled their evolution. We analyzed a sequence of well-preserved inner-bank bar deposits within the meander bends of a multistacked sinuous fluvial ridge in Aeolis Dorsa and compared them to similar features on Earth to establish the conditions required for their formation. Our results reveal that these Martian channels were highly aggradational, rising an order of magnitude higher than terrestrial rivers. This evolution occurred over very rapid time scales, with our estimates suggesting that some entire inner-bar set deposits, and therefore the aggradational channel, may have formed in less than a single Martian year, with upper bounds of a few decades. We suggest that this unique channel topography was created by a rapidly rising downstream water body, triggered by a sequence of externally sourced megafloods (e.g., crater lake breaches).",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/28/618748/Rapid-megaflood-triggered-base-level-rise-on-Mars,2023-01-21

Major-element geochemistry of pelites,"Pelites (shales and mudstones) are arguably the most important rock type for interpreting metamorphism. Their significance derives from their widespread occurrence and the range of mineral assemblages they develop at different conditions of pressure and temperature. We compiled a global database of 5729 major-element whole-rock analyses of pelites from different metamorphic grades (shales to granulite-facies paragneisses) to (1) determine an average composition, (2) examine the range and variability in their composition, and (3) assess if there is evidence for grade-related geochemical changes. Median values are given instead of average values to eliminate the effect of extremes. The median worldwide pelite is as follows (anhydrous, values in wt%): SiO2 = 64.13, TiO2 = 0.91, Al2O3 = 19.63, FeOtotal = 6.85, MnO = 0.08, MgO = 2.41, CaO = 0.65, Na2O = 1.38, and K2O = 3.95. The median XMg = MgO/(MgO + FeOtotal) in moles is 0.39. The median XFe3+ = 2 × Fe2O3/(2 × Fe2O3 + FeO) in moles was measured in 1964 samples and is 0.23. On an Al2O3-FeO-MgO (AFM) diagram, the median worldwide pelite plots within a strong clustering of analyses between  = projected molar MgO/(MgO + FeOtotal) = 0.30–0.55 (median = 0.42) and AMs = molar [Al2O3 – (3 × K2O)]/[Al2O3 – (3 × K2O) + FeOtotal + MgO] = 0.0–0.4 (median = 0.19). Pelites show a continuous decrease in volatile content with increasing meta-morphic grade and a decrease in XFe3+ from the diagenetic to biotite zone. Lower median SiO2 values and higher median Al2O3 and AMs values in the porphyroblast and subsolidus sillimanite or K-feldspar zones, as well as higher median MnO values in the garnet zone, may reflect sampling bias or metasomatism.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/39/618721/Major-element-geochemistry-of-pelites,2023-01-21

"Heavy Mo isotope composition of northern Bataan adakites, Philippines: Evidence for fore-arc subduction erosion?","The identification of an eroded fore-arc crust component in arc magmas is challenging due to the combined effects of mantle metasomatism and crustal assimilation–fractional crystallization. In this study, molybdenum (Mo) isotope compositions are used in conjunction with Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic and elemental data to identify eroded fore-arc crust components in adakites from the Cuyapo and Balungao volcanoes of the northern Bataan segment of the Luzon arc (Philippines). The Mo isotopic ratios (δ98/95Mo, relative to the NIST SRM 3134 standard) of these adakites increase with increasing εNd (+4.3 to +5.6) and Ba/Nb (206–286). The low δ98/95Mo (−0.36‰ to −0.26‰) in the Cuyapo adakites coupled with low Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic ratios suggests contributions from the residual slab, which lost isotopically heavy Mo during dehydration. Interestingly, the high δ98/95Mo (−0.18‰ to 0.00‰) Balungao adakites have Mo-Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic ratios similar to those of the Luzon basement. Fractionated Nb/Ta (16–18) and high Sr/Y indicate the coexistence of melt with residual rutile and garnet ± amphibole assemblages, corresponding to a source region (>~45 km) below the present Luzon crust (~33 km). This thus suggests an origin of heavy Mo from partial melting of eroded crust in the mantle wedge rather than in the upper-plate crust. Our work not only demonstrates that Mo isotopes may be a potential tracer of eroded crust but also highlights that lavas with combined high δ98/95Mo, εNd, and Ba/Nb emplaced at subduction zones with juvenile arc crust may be a result of subduction erosion.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/49/618722/Heavy-Mo-isotope-composition-of-northern-Bataan,2023-01-21
A tool to distinguish magmatic from secondarily recrystallized carbonatites—Calcite/apatite rare earth element partitioning,"Crustal geochemical signatures in carbonatites may arise from carbon recycling through the mantle or from fluid-mediated interaction with the continental crust. To distinguish igneous from fluid-mediated processes, we experimentally determined rare earth element (REE) partitioning between calcite/melt and apatite/melt at subvolcanic emplacement conditions (1–2 kbar, 750–1000 °C). Our data allow modeling of calcite-apatite (Cc/Ap) partition coefficients (D), representing a new tool to bypass the previously required but largely unknown carbonatite melt composition. Experimentally determined magmatic calcite/apatite REE patterns are flat, as  is ~0.75, and they show a slight U-shape that becomes more pronounced with temperature decreasing from 1000 to 750 °C. Application to texturally well-equilibrated natural Ca-carbonatites and calcite-bearing nephelinites shows that some calcite-apatite pairs follow this pattern and, hence, confirm the magmatic nature of the carbonates.  values of other mineral pairs range from 10−2 to 10−3, which, together with a substantial light REE depletion in the calcite, is interpreted as fluid-mediated light REE removal during secondary calcite recrystallization. Calcite/apatite REE distributions are well suited to evaluate whether a carbonatite mineralogy is primary and magmatic or has been affected by secondary recrystallization. In this sense, our tool provides information about the sample's primary or secondary nature, which is essential when assigning isotopic crustal signatures (in Ca, C, or Sr) or REE patterns to related geologic processes.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/54/618718/A-tool-to-distinguish-magmatic-from-secondarily,2023-01-21
Kovdor to Oldoinyo Lengai—The missing link in carbonatitic magma evolution,"Experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that interaction of a carbonatitic magma with quartz-rich rocks plays a key role in shaping carbonatite complexes. The host rocks were represented by quartz, and the magma was represented by synthetic mixtures of CaCO3, MgCO3, and Na2CO3. With increasing distance from the quartz, the reaction between the carbonate liquid and quartz produced a domain of Na(Ca)-rich silicate glass, a domain of metasomatic wollastonite, diopside, and forsterite, and a carbonate-rich domain. This zonation reproduces that observed in many carbonatite complexes, e.g., Kovdor, Russia. The experiments provide strong evidence that carbonatitic magma/host-rock interaction controls the evolution of carbonatite complexes and explains how Mg-Ca-carbonatitic magmas from the mantle can evolve to produce the natrocarbonatites and associated alkaline silicate rocks observed at Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/59/618716/Kovdor-to-Oldoinyo-Lengai-The-missing-link-in,2023-01-21

Sponge-rich sediment recycling in a Paleozoic continental arc driven by mélange melting,"Slab material transfer processes in continental arcs can be challenging to decipher because magmas are often characterized by significant contributions from continental material. In this study, we identified a Prototethyan continental arc (419–418 Ma) that is now located in the Dazhonghe area of the southeast Tibetan Plateau, which, based on Sr-Nd-Hf-O-Si isotope relationships, implies no detectable continental material contributions. The Dazhonghe arc rocks display much lower δ30Si values than modern arc rocks and average mantle; this is best explained by subduction of sponge-rich marine sediments, which are thought to have been the dominant marine organisms during the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic. Our mixing calculations reveal that only bulk mixing among sponge-rich sediments, altered oceanic crust (AOC), and the depleted mantle would be capable of accounting for all the Sr-Nd-Hf-O-Si isotope compositions. This finding implies that the Dazhonghe arc magmas were generated by melting of a mélange that formed at the slab-mantle interface. The Dazhonghe continental arc is the first for which mélange melting has been confirmed.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/75/619176/Sponge-rich-sediment-recycling-in-a-Paleozoic,2023-01-21
"Silicification of trilobites and biofilm from the Cambrian Weeks Formation, Utah: Evidence for microbial mediation of silicification","We report on silicified trilobite sclerites with associated silicified biofilm from the Cambrian Weeks Formation, Utah (USA), that support a role for microbial biofilms in silicification. Silicified sclerites are typically small (<3 mm) and incompletely preserved. All studied specimens are partly coated in 5–20 µm (rarely >500 µm) of silica-cemented matrix. High-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) study reveals the presence of two different forms of carbon-rich threads, ribbons and mats, coating both sclerites and silica-cemented matrix. Crystalline-looking biofilm threads and ribbons composed of Si, O, and C are interpreted as silicified biofilm associated with the trilobite silicification. Rippled to smooth biofilm mats composed of more C, less Si and O, and a trace of N are post-silicification. Embedded in the silica of the sclerites and matrix are molds of framboids that we interpret as originally framboidal pyrite that was engulfed by silica. These data indicate that silica precipitation continued into the surrounding matrix following the propagation of sulfate-reducing bacteria feeding on the organic matter present in the sclerite and the neighboring sediment. This strongly supports the model that bacterially mediated decay is key to the silicification of carbonate bioclasts and provides the first direct evidence of a microbial community (biofilm). A literature review reveals that silica extends past the fossil more frequently than is recognized, suggesting that silicified biofilm might be common but overlooked.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/80/619174/Silicification-of-trilobites-and-biofilm-from-the,2023-01-21
Diagenetic priming of submarine landslides in ooze-rich substrates,"Oozes are the most widespread deep-sea sediment in the global ocean, but very little is known about how changes in their physical properties during burial impact slope stability and related geohazards. We used three-dimensional seismic reflection, geochemical, and petrophysical data acquired both within and adjacent to 13 large (in total ~6330 km2) submarine slides on the Exmouth Plateau, North West Shelf, Australia, to investigate how the pre-slide physical properties of oozes control slope failure and emplacement processes. Our integrated data set allows potential slide surfaces to be detected within ooze successions, a crucial advance for improved submarine geohazard assessment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the interplay of tectonics, ocean current activity, and silica diagenesis can prime multiple slides on very low-gradient slopes in tropical oceanic basins. Therefore, the diagenetic state of silica-rich sediments should be considered in future studies to improve slope stability assessments.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/85/619168/Diagenetic-priming-of-submarine-landslides-in-ooze,2023-01-21
Fault permeability from stochastic modeling of clay smears,"In normally consolidated, shallow (depth <~3 km) siliciclastic sequences, faults develop clay smears. Existing models include the dependence of permeability on the clay fraction, but improved predictions of fault permeability should account for uncertainty and anisotropy. We introduce PREDICT, a methodology that computes probability distributions for the directional components (dip-normal, strike-parallel, and dip-parallel) of the fault permeability tensor from statistical samples for a set of geological variables. These variables, which include geometrical, compositional, and mechanical properties, allow multiple discretizations of the fault core to be populated with sand and clay smears, which can be used to upscale the permeability to a coarser scale (e.g., suitable for reservoir modeling). We validated our implementation with experimental data and applied PREDICT to several stratigraphic sequences. We show that fault permeability is controlled by the clay smear configuration and, crucially, that it typically exhibits multimodal probability distributions due to the existence of holes. The latter is a unique feature of our algorithm, which can be used to build fault permeability scenarios to manage and mitigate risk in subsurface applications.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/91/619200/Fault-permeability-from-stochastic-modeling-of,2023-01-21

Trends and rhythms in carbonatites and kimberlites reflect thermo-tectonic evolution of Earth,"Earth's thermo-tectonic evolution determines the way the planet's interior and surface interact and shows temporal changes in both trends and periodic rhythms. By sampling the subcontinental lithospheric mantle that represents the interface between the convecting mantle and the crust, carbonatite and kimberlite should be ideal rock types for documenting this evolution. The first-order secular rise of kimberlites over time has been noted by researchers, but there is much debate over how to interpret this trend, and their second-order variability has received less attention. We compiled a comprehensive global carbonatite database and compared it with an existing kimberlite one. We find that the numbers of carbonatites and kimberlites have similar increasing secular trends, with accelerated growth after ca. 1 Ga, and show the same periodic rhythms that have been synchronized to the supercontinent cycle since ca. 2.1 Ga. We link these trends and rhythms to the long-term change of Earth and the supercontinent cycle, both of which have altered the temperature of, and the subduction-recycled volatile flux into, the subcontinental lithosphere. Such consistent records in carbonatite and kimberlite behavior provide critical evidence for the synchronous thermo-tectonic evolution of the entire subcontinental lithosphere.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/101/619201/Trends-and-rhythms-in-carbonatites-and-kimberlites,2023-01-21

Preferential preservation of low-elevation biotas in the nonmarine fossil record,"Modern coastal sedimentary basins typically lie at low elevations (<600 m), whereas inland basins commonly occupy elevations as high as 4000–5000 m. Individual basins of all types typically preserve a narrower span of elevations, generally <1000 m, and typically near 200–300 m in coastal basins. As a result, the nonmarine fossil record is expected to preserve mainly low-elevation habitats and a relatively narrow range of elevations. Because many of the basins that preserve high elevations are likely to undergo subsequent destruction via erosion or continental collision, the dominance of low-elevation habitats is likely to become stronger into deep time. This selective preservation of nonmarine communities from sedimentary basins, and specifically from low elevations, suggests that much or even most of ancient nonmarine biodiversity is not preserved. Given the occurrence of many modern biodiversity hotspots in regions of high elevation, long ghost lineages are likely common in the nonmarine fossil record, and divergence times estimated from the nonmarine fossil record may be systematically far too short. The spans of elevations that are preserved in sedimentary basins suggest that the fossil record may preserve gradients in community composition that are correlated with elevation, yet they have been largely undetected.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/111/619177/Preferential-preservation-of-low-elevation-biotas,2023-01-21
Fluid inclusion evidence for overpressure-induced shale oil accumulation,"Shale oil is becoming increasingly important in the global energy market, but its accumulation mechanism is not fully understood. We present novel and direct fluid inclusion data from the Lower Permian Fengcheng Formation, Mahu Sag, Junggar Basin, northwest China. Shortite veins in this source rock contain abundant two-phase gas-liquid hydrocarbon inclusions and coeval aqueous inclusions. The inclusions have highly variable degrees of bubble filling (5–80 vol% vapor) and homogenization temperature differences between oil and aqueous inclusions (~50 °C), which demonstrate that fluid (oil-gas-water) immiscibility occurred at high pressures. The hydrocarbon inclusions record different levels of fluid over-pressure (32.9–43.0 MPa), with a paleopressure coefficient of 1.3–1.7. Episodic fluid over-pressure release resulted in shale oil accumulation, with faults/fractures acting as important migration pathways. Oil from deeper and more mature source rocks within the Fengcheng Formation was expelled upward to the shale oil reservoir. These processes are common and important in shale oil systems. These results show that the accumulation of unconventional hydrocarbons occurs pervasively within the reservoirs, and fluid displacement is critical in exploration and exploitation.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/51/1/115/619169/Fluid-inclusion-evidence-for-overpressure-induced,2023-01-21

"Metamorphism obscures primary taphonomic pathways in the early Cambrian Sirius Passet Lagerstätte, North Greenland","Correct interpretation of soft-bodied fossils relies on a thorough understanding of their taphonomy. While the focus has often been on the primary roles of decay and early diagenesis, the impacts of deeper burial and metamorphism on fossil preservation are less well understood. We document a sequence of late-stage mineral replacements in panarthropod fossils from the Sirius Passet Lagerstätte (North Greenland), an important early Cambrian Burgess Shale–type (BST) biota. Muscle and gut diverticula were initially stabilized by early diagenetic apatite, prior to being pervasively replaced by quartz and then subordinate chlorite, muscovite, and chloritoid during very low- to low-grade metamorphism. Each new mineral replicates the soft tissues with different precision and occurs in particular anatomical regions, imposing strong biases on the biological information retained. Muscovite and chloritoid largely obliterate the tissues’ original detail, suggesting that aluminum-rich protoliths may have least potential for conserving mineralized soft tissues in metamorphism. Overall, the fossils exhibit a marked shift toward mineralogical equilibration with the matrix, obscuring primary taphonomic modes. Sequential replacement of the phosphatized soft tissues released phosphorus to form new accessory monazite (and apatite and xenotime), whose presence in other BST biotas might signal the prior, more widespread, occurrence of this primary mode of preservation. Our results provide critical context for interpreting the Sirius Passet biota and for identifying late-stage overprints in other biotas.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/4/607799/Metamorphism-obscures-primary-taphonomic-pathways,2023-01-24
Boninitic blueschists record subduction initiation and subsequent accretion of an arc–forearc in the northeast Proto-Tethys Ocean,"Subduction of oceanic lithosphere is a diagnostic characteristic of plate tectonics. However, the geodynamic processes from initiation to termination of subduction zones remain enigmatic mainly due to the scarcity of appropriate rock records. We report the first discovery of early Paleozoic boninitic blueschists and associated greenschists from the eastern Proto-Tethyan North Qilian orogenic belt, northeastern Tibet, which have geochemical affinities that are typical of forearc boninites and island arc basalts, respectively. The boninitic protoliths of the blueschists record intra-oceanic subduction initiation at ca. 492–488 Ma in the eastern North Qilian arc/forearc–backarc system, whereas peak blueschist facies metamorphism reflects subsequent subduction of the arc/forearc complex to high pressure at ca. 455 Ma. These relations therefore record the life circle of an intra-oceanic subduction zone within the northeastern Proto-Tethys Ocean. The geodynamic evolution provides an early Paleozoic analogue of the early development of the Izu–Bonin–Mariana arc and its later subduction beneath the extant Japanese arc margin. This finding highlights the important role of subduction of former upper plate island arc/forearcs in reducing the likelihood of preservation of initial subduction-related rock records in ancient orogenic belts.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/10/607464/Boninitic-blueschists-record-subduction-initiation,2023-01-24
Extreme event-driven sediment aggradation and erosional buffering along a tectonic gradient in southern Taiwan,"In most landscape evolution models, extreme rainfall enhances river incision. In steep landscapes, however, these events trigger landslides that can buffer incision via increased sediment delivery and aggradation. We quantify landslide sediment aggradation and erosional buffering with a natural experiment in southern Taiwan where a northward gradient in tectonic activity drives increasing landscape steepness. We find that landscape response to extreme rainfall during the 2009 typhoon Morakot varied along this gradient, where steep areas experienced widespread channel sediment aggradation of >10 m and less steep areas did not noticeably aggrade. We model sediment export to estimate a sediment removal timeline and find that steep, tectonically active areas with the most aggradation may take centuries to resume bedrock incision. Expected sediment cover duration reflects tectonic uplift. We find that despite high stream power, sediment cover may keep steep channels from eroding bedrock for up to half of a given time period. This work highlights the importance of dynamic sediment cover in landscape evolution and suggests a mechanism by which erosional efficiency in tectonically active landscapes may decrease as landscape steepness increases.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/16/607466/Extreme-event-driven-sediment-aggradation-and,2023-01-24
"Contribution of orbital forcing and Deccan volcanism to global climatic and biotic changes across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary at Zumaia, Spain","Untangling the timing of the environmental effects of Deccan volcanism with respect to the Chicxulub impact is instrumental to fully assessing the contributions of both to climate change over the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (KPB) interval. Despite recent improvements in radiometric age calibrations, the accuracy of age constraints and correlations is insufficient to resolve the exact mechanisms leading to environmental and climate change in the 1 m.y. across the KPB. We present new high-resolution planktic foraminiferal, geochemical, and geophysical data from the Zumaia section (Spain), calibrated to an updated orbitally tuned age model. We provide a revised chronology for the major carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) and planktic foraminiferal events and test temporal relationships with different models of the eruptive phases of the Deccan Traps. Our data show that the major CIEs near the KPB, i.e., the late Maastrichtian warming event (66.25–66.10 Ma) and the Dan-C2 event (65.8–65.7 Ma), are synchronous with the last and the first 405 k.y. eccentricity maximum of the Maastrichtian and the Danian, respectively, and that the minor Lower C29n event (65.48–65.41 Ma) is well constrained to a short eccentricity maximum. Conversely, we obtained evidence of abrupt environmental change likely related to Deccan volcanism at ca. 65.9 Ma, based on a bloom of opportunistic triserial guembelitriids (Chiloguembelitria). The orbital, isotopic, and paleobiological temporal relationships with Deccan volcanism established here provide new insights into the role of Deccan volcanism in climate and environmental change in the 1 m.y. across the KPB.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/21/607267/Contribution-of-orbital-forcing-and-Deccan,2023-01-24
Volcanic plumbing filters on ocean-island basalt geochemistry,"Ocean-island basalts (OIBs) are considered to be messengers from the deep mantle, yet the filtering effect of the plumbing systems that bring OIB melts to the surface remains poorly assessed. We investigated volcanic products from El Hierro island (Canary Islands) from textural and chemical perspectives. The majority of geochemical data cluster at relatively fractionated basaltic compositions of 5 wt% MgO. Compositions ≥10 wt% MgO are porphyritic whole rocks that accumulate mafic minerals. Near-primary melts do not erupt. Instead, we show that carrier melts (crystal-free whole rocks, glasses, and melt inclusions) are consistently buffered to low-MgO compositions during passage through the plumbing system. We tested our model of melt fractionation and crystal accumulation on a global compilation of OIBs. Similar to El Hierro, the majority of data cluster at evolved compositions of 5 wt% MgO (alkaline) to 7 wt% MgO (tholeiitic). Modeling the fractionation of OIB parental melts, we show that with 50% crystallization, OIB melts reach 5 wt% MgO with reduced density, increased volatile content, and overall low viscosity, becoming positively buoyant relative to wall rocks and highly eruptible when reaching volatile saturation at depths around the crust-mantle boundary. Under these conditions, 5 wt% MgO OIB “sweet spot” melts are propelled to the surface and erupt carrying an assortment of recycled crystals. This mechanism is consistent with the petrography and chemistry of erupted products and suggests OIB volcanoes are dominated by low-MgO basaltic melts.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/26/607641/Volcanic-plumbing-filters-on-ocean-island-basalt,2023-01-24
"Carbon isotope excursions during the late Miocene recorded by lipids of marine Thaumarchaeota, Piedmont Basin, Mediterranean Sea","Group I mesophilic Thaumarchaeota fix dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), accompanied by a biosynthetic fractionation factor of ~20‰. Accordingly, the δ13C signature of their diagnostic biomarker crenarchaeol was suggested as a potential δ13CDIC proxy in marine basins if input from nonmarine Thaumarchaeota is negligible. Semi-enclosed basins are sensitive to carbon-cycle perturbations, because they tend to develop thermohaline stratification. Water column stratification typified the semi-enclosed basins of the Mediterranean Sea during the late Miocene (Messinian) salinity crisis (5.97–5.33 Ma). To assess how the advent of the crisis affected the carbon cycle, we studied sediments of the Piedmont Basin (northwestern Italy), the northernmost Mediterranean subbasin. A potential bias of our δ13CDIC reconstructions from the input of soil Thaumarchaeota is discarded, since high and increasing branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index values do not correspond to low and decreasing δ13C values for thaumarchaeal lipids, which would be expected in case of high input from soil Thaumarchaeota. Before the onset of the crisis, the permanently stratified distal part of the basin hosted a water mass below the chemocline with a δ13CDIC value of approximately −3.5‰, while the well-mixed proximal part had a δ13CDIC value of approximately −0.8‰. The advent of the crisis was marked by 13C enrichment of the DIC pool, with positive δ13CDIC excursions up to +5‰ in the upper water column. Export of 12C to the seafloor after phytoplankton blooms and limited replenishment of remineralized carbon due to the stabilization of thermohaline stratification primarily caused such 13C enrichment of the DIC pool.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/32/607640/Carbon-isotope-excursions-during-the-late-Miocene,2023-01-24
Rivers in reverse: Upstream-migrating dechannelization and flooding cause avulsions on fluvial fans,"The process of river avulsion builds floodplains and fills alluvial basins. We report on a new style of river avulsion identified in the Landsat satellite record. We found 69 examples of retrogradational avulsions on rivers of densely forested fluvial fans in the Andean and New Guinean alluvial basins. Retrogradational avulsions are initiated by a channel blockage, e.g., a logjam, that fills the channel with sediment and forces water overbank (dechannelization), which creates a chevron-shaped flooding pattern. Dechannelization waves travel upstream at a median rate of 387 m/yr and last on average for 13 yr; many rivers show multiple dechannelizing events on the same reach. Dechannelization ends and the avulsion is complete when the river finds a new flow path. We simulate upstream-migrating dechannelization with a one-dimensional morphodynamic model for open channel flow. Observations are consistent with model results and show that channel blockages can cause dechannelization on steep (10−2 to 10−3), low-discharge (~101 m3 s−1) rivers. This illustrates a new style of floodplain sedimentation that is unaccounted for in ecologic and stratigraphic models.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/37/607793/Rivers-in-reverse-Upstream-migrating,2023-01-24
"Orbital control of Pleistocene euxinia in Lake Magadi, Kenya","Lake Magadi is an internally drained, saline and alkaline terminal sump in the southern Kenya Rift. Geochemistry of samples from an ~200 m core representing the past ~1 m.y. of the lake's history shows some of the highest concentrations of transition metals and metalloids ever reported from lacustrine sediment, including redox-sensitive elements molybdenum, arsenic, and vanadium. Elevated concentrations of these elements represent times when the lake's hypolimnion was euxinic—that is, anoxic, saline, and sulfide-rich. Euxinia was common after ca. 700 ka, and after that tended to occur during intervals of high orbital eccentricity. These were likely times when high-frequency hydrologic changes favored repeated episodes of euxinia and sulfide precipitation. High-amplitude environmental fluctuations at peak eccentricity likely impacted water balance in terrestrial habitats and resource availability for early hominins. These are associated with important events in human evolution, including the first appearance of Middle Stone Age technology between ca. 500 and 320 ka in the southern Kenya Rift.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/42/607797/Orbital-control-of-Pleistocene-euxinia-in-Lake,2023-01-24
Guttulatic calcite: A carbonate microtexture that reveals frigid formation conditions,"The paragenesis of carbonate pseudomorphic textures in the rock record that are inferred to represent replaced metastable ikaite (CaCO3·6H2O), which forms at frigid temperatures, is uncertain. Petrographic analysis of Mono Lake (California, USA) Pleistocene tufas allowed recognition of a distinctive calcite microtexture, termed guttulatic calcite, that forms during carbonate dehydration and is diagnostic for precursor ikaite. The texture is characterized by pseudo-hexagonal or spherical low-Mg cores, which likely formed initially as vaterite, with an ellipsoidal overgrowth, and a secondary high-Mg sparry or micritic cement. Observations of Mono Lake ikaite pseudomorphs, combined with a review of more ancient examples, indicate that guttulatic texture records carbonate dehydration of precursor ikaite and can be used to infer frigid paleotemperatures.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/48/607791/Guttulatic-calcite-A-carbonate-microtexture-that,2023-01-24
"Late Quaternary geochronologic record of soil formation and erosion: Effects of climate change on Mojave Desert hillslopes (Nevada, USA)","Climate change is an often-cited control on geomorphic processes in the arid southwestern United States, but links to direct climatic factors and vegetation change remain under debate. Hillslopes at a site in the eastern Mojave Desert in southern Nevada are mantled by 0–1.5 m of colluvial deposits. Accumulation of weathered bedrock combined with eolian inputs of fine sand and silt led to the formation of well-developed soil profiles. Surface sediments from both sources were incorporated into colluvium, allowing both processes to be dated with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). OSL ages indicate a period of increased colluviation in the Late Pleistocene facilitated by enhanced bedrock weathering and dust deposition. Hillslope aspect strongly controls predominant soil environments and associated vegetation. Well-developed soils with dense grass cover extensively mantle the mesic north-aspect hillslopes, while more xeric south-aspect hillslopes are dominated by thin colluvium with minimal soil development, extensive bedrock exposure, and desertscrub vegetation. Remnants of older colluvium with moderately developed soils on south aspects, however, indicate they were once more extensively mantled by thicker colluvial deposits. The transition to drier conditions in the Holocene diminished vegetation cover on more xeric south aspects, triggering widespread erosion, whereas the more mesic north aspects retained denser grass cover that minimized erosion. The transition to drier conditions in the Holocene altered the vegetation; however, persistent perennial grass cover minimized erosion into the middle Holocene. Increasing aridity during the middle Holocene significantly reduced grass cover on more xeric south aspects, triggering erosion and alluvial deposition. OSL dates of dust incorporated into terrace sediments indicate late Middle Holocene aggradation and soil development in the Late Holocene. In contrast, maintenance of substantial perennial grass cover on mesic north aspects minimized erosion from those hillslopes throughout the Holocene.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/54/608091/Late-Quaternary-geochronologic-record-of-soil,2023-01-24
"Propagating uplift controls on high-elevation, low-relief landscape formation in the southeast Tibetan Plateau","High-elevation, low-relief surfaces are widespread in many mountain belts. However, the origin of these surfaces has long been debated. In particular, the southeast Tibetan Plateau has extensive low-relief surfaces perched above deep valleys and in the headwaters of three of the world's largest rivers (Salween, Mekong, and Yangtze Rivers). Various geologic data and geodynamic models show that many mountain belts grow first to a certain height and then laterally in an outward propagation sequence. By translating this information into a kinematic propagating uplift function in a landscape evolution model, we propose that the high-elevation, low-relief surfaces in the southeast Tibetan Plateau are simply a consequence of mountain growth and do not require a special process to form. The propagating uplift forms an elongated river network geometry with broad high-elevation, low-relief headwaters and interfluves that persist for tens of millions of years, consistent with the observed geochronology. We suggest that the low-relief interfluves can be long-lived because they lack the drainage networks necessary to keep pace with the rapid incision of the large main-stem rivers. The propagating uplift also produces spatial and temporal exhumation patterns and river profile morphologies that match observations. Our modeling therefore reconciles geomorphic observations with geodynamic models of uplift of the southeast Tibetan Plateau, and it provides a simple mechanism to explain the low-relief surfaces observed in several mountain belts on Earth.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/60/607794/Propagating-uplift-controls-on-high-elevation-low,2023-01-24
Unraveling the histories of Proterozoic shales through in situ Rb-Sr dating and trace element laser ablation analysis,"Authigenic components in marine sediments are important archives for past environment reconstructions. However, defining reliable age constraints and assessing the effects of post-depositional overprints in Precambrian sequences are challenging. We demonstrate a new laser-based analytical approach that has the potential to rapidly and accurately evaluate the depositional and alteration histories of Proterozoic shales. Our study employs a novel application of in situ Rb-Sr dating coupled with simultaneous trace-element analysis using reaction-cell laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–tandem mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS/MS). We present results from shales sourced from two wells in the Proterozoic McArthur Basin, northern Australia. These rocks have been widely used by previous studies as a key section for ancient biogeochemical and paleo-redox reconstructions. Shales from well UR5 yielded initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios, Rb-Sr ages, and rare earth element plus yttrium (REEY) patterns similar to those of a dolerite sampled from the same core. We propose that the UR5 samples chronicle hydrothermal alteration instigated by the dolerite intrusion. In contrast, a correlative shale from well UR6 yielded an age consistent with the expected depositional age (1577 ±56 Ma) with REEY and initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios similar to ca. 1.5 Ga seawater. We suggest that this sample records the minimum depositional age and early marine diagenetic history for this unit. This new technique can date Proterozoic shales quickly, cheaply, and with minimum sample preparation. Importantly, ages are triaged to differentiate between those recording primary marine versus secondary processes. This novel approach provides a potentially powerful tool for dating and fingerprinting the vast array of ancient marine shales for further studies of Earth systems through deep time.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/66/607798/Unraveling-the-histories-of-Proterozoic-shales,2023-01-24
"Linking lava morphologies to effusion rates for the 2014–2015 Holuhraun lava flow field, Iceland","Determining the parameters that control fissure-fed lava morphologies is critical for reconstructing the complex emplacement histories of eruptions on Earth and other planetary bodies. We used a geomorphological map of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun lava flow field, in combination with new constraints on lava emplacement chronology and two independently derived time-averaged discharge rate (TADR) data sets, to analyze correlations between lava morphology and effusion rate. Results show that lava morphologies are dominantly controlled by effusion rate at the vent during the early phases of the eruption and by lava transport processes as the system evolves. Initially, TADR and its variance, which reflect pulsation in the lava supply rate from the vent, directly affect lava emplacement styles. However, as the eruption progresses, the lava transport system exerts a stronger control with channels and ponds that can either dampen variation in local effusion rate or create surges during sudden drainage events. The Holuhraun eruption predominantly produced rubbly lava in its earlier eruption phases and transitioned into the production of spiny lava toward the end of the eruption. However, a drop of TADR during the first phase of the eruption correlates with a decrease in rubbly lava formation and an increase in spiny lava production. This suggests that a change in effusion rate caused the observed transition in lava type. Our findings show that rubbly lava is formed under relatively high local effusion rates with pulsating supply conditions, whereas spiny lava is formed under lower local effusion rates and steadier supply.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/71/607796/Linking-lava-morphologies-to-effusion-rates-for,2023-01-24
Diversification of Archean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suites in a mushy middle crust,"Tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suites are the dominant component of Earth's first continents, but their origins are debated. The trace element concentrations of these rocks are conventionally linked to their source depths and inferred geodynamic settings with the implicit assumption that TTG compositions are source-controlled. Alternatively, their variable compositions may be caused by fractional crystallization in TTG plutons after emplacement and less clearly linked to source depth. Most TTGs in Archean mid-crustal exposures are the dominant component of igneous gray gneiss complexes; the processes that influence the evolution of TTG magmas in this setting are poorly understood. We present a petrological–geochemical model that explains the coexistence of TTGs in the middle crust with low-pressure and high-pressure geochemical trends, irrespective of tectonic setting or depth of the TTG source. We propose that mid-crustal TTGs were long-lived crystal mushes with compositions controlled by the separation of early-crystallizing plagioclase and melt. Using phase equilibrium modeling, we demonstrate that a suite of TTGs from the southern Superior Province in Canada represents variably plagioclase-rich and melt-rich fractions from a common parent magma. The behavior of plagioclase may have a strong influence on the geochemical trends of TTGs, including the degree of rare earth element fractionation. Our results suggest that trace element compositions of TTGs may not primarily reflect the depth of the source and cannot be used alone to infer Archean geodynamic settings.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/76/607795/Diversification-of-Archean-tonalite-trondhjemite,2023-01-24
Thermodynamic limits for assimilation of silicate crust in primitive magmas,"Some geochemical models for basaltic and more primitive rocks suggest that their parental magmas have assimilated tens of weight percent of crustal silicate wall rock. But what are the thermodynamic limits for assimilation in primitive magmas? We pursue this question quantitatively using a freely available thermodynamic tool for phase equilibria modeling of open magmatic systems—the Magma Chamber Simulator (https://mcs.geol.ucsb.edu)—and focus on modeling assimilation of wall-rock partial melts, which is thermodynamically more efficient compared to bulk assimilation of stoped wall-rock blocks in primitive igneous systems. In the simulations, diverse komatiitic, picritic, and basaltic parental magmas assimilate progressive partial melts of preheated average lower, middle, and upper crust in amounts allowed by thermodynamics. Our results indicate that it is difficult for any subalkaline primitive magma to assimilate more than 20−30 wt% of upper or middle crust before evolving to compositions with higher SiO2 than a basaltic magma (52 wt%). On the other hand, typical komatiitic magmas have thermodynamic potential to assimilate as much as their own mass (59−102 wt%) of lower crust and retain a basaltic composition. The compositions of the parental melt and the assimilant heavily influence both how much assimilation is energetically possible in primitive magmas and the final magma composition given typical temperatures. These findings have important implications for the role of assimilation in the generation and evolution of, e.g., ultramafic to mafic trans-Moho magmatic systems, siliceous high-Mg basalts, and massif-type anorthosites.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/81/608089/Thermodynamic-limits-for-assimilation-of-silicate,2023-01-24
New estimates of the magnitude of the sea-level jump during the 8.2 ka event,"We analyzed sediment cores from coastal Lake Izabal, Guatemala, to infer Holocene biogeochemical changes in the lake. At ca. 8370 calibrated yr B.P. (cal. yr B.P.), marine waters entered the lake, which presently lies ~38 km from the Caribbean coast. Temporal correlation between Early Holocene drainage of high-latitude Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway (in North America) and marine flooding of Lake Izabal suggests a causal link between the two processes. Our data indicate a relative sea-level jump of 2.60 ± 0.88 m, which is larger than previous estimates of sea-level rise during the 8.2 ka event. The inferred sea-level jump, however, cannot be explained solely by the volume of water released during drainage of Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway. Instead, we propose that previous studies underestimated the magnitude of Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway discharge, or that additional meltwater sources contributed to global sea-level rise at that time.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/86/608090/New-estimates-of-the-magnitude-of-the-sea-level,2023-01-24
Mantle heating at ca. 2 Ga by continental insulation: Evidence from granites and eclogites,"Igneous and metamorphic rocks contain the mineralogical and geochemical record of thermally driven processes on Earth. The generally accepted thermal budget of the mantle indicates a steady cooling trend since the Archean. The geological record, however, indicates this simple cooling model may not hold true. Subduction-related eclogites substantially emerge in the rock record from 2.1 Ga to 1.8 Ga, indicating that average mantle thermal conditions cooled below a critical threshold for widespread eclogite preservation. Following this period, eclogite disappeared again until ca. 1.1 Ga. Coincident with the transient emergence of eclogite, global granite chemistry recorded a decrease in Sr and Eu and increases in yttrium and heavy rare earth element (HREE) concentrations. These changes are most simply explained by warming of the thermal regime associated with granite genesis. We suggest that warming was caused by increased continental insulation of the mantle at this time. Ultimately, secular cooling of the mantle overcame insulation, allowing the second emergence and preservation of eclogite from ca. 1.1 Ga until present.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/91/607792/Mantle-heating-at-ca-2-Ga-by-continental,2023-01-24
"Spatio-temporal evolution of the Christiana-Santorini-Kolumbo volcanic field, Aegean Sea","The Christiana-Santorini-Kolumbo volcanic field (CSKVF) in the Aegean Sea is one of the most active volcano-tectonic lineaments in Europe. Santorini has been an iconic site in volcanology and archaeology since the 19th century, and the onshore volcanic products of Santorini are one of the best-studied volcanic sequences worldwide. However, little is known about the chronology of volcanic activity of the adjacent submarine Kolumbo volcano, and even less is known about the Christiana volcanic island. In this study, we exploit a dense array of high-resolution marine seismic reflection profiles to link the marine stratigraphy to onshore volcanic sequences and present the first consistent chronological framework for the CSKVF, enabling a detailed reconstruction of the evolution of the volcanic rift system in time and space. We identify four main phases of volcanic activity, which initiated in the Pliocene with the formation of the Christiana volcano (phase 1). The formation of the current southwest-northeast–trending rift system (phase 2) was associated with the evolution of two distinct volcanic centers, the newly discovered Poseidon center and the early Kolumbo volcano. Phase 3 saw a period of widespread volcanic activity throughout the entire rift. The ongoing phase 4 is confined to the Santorini caldera and Kolumbo volcano. Our study highlights the fundamental tectonic control on magma emplacement and shows that the CSKVF evolved from a volcanic field with local centers that matured only recently to form the vast Santorini edifice.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/96/608223/Spatio-temporal-evolution-of-the-Christiana,2023-01-24
The influence of rock uplift rate on the formation and preservation of individual marine terraces during multiple sea-level stands,"Marine terraces are a cornerstone for the study of paleo sea level and crustal deformation. Commonly, individual erosive marine terraces are attributed to unique sea-level high stands based on the reasoning that marine platforms could only be significantly widened at the beginning of an interglacial. However, this logic implies that wave erosion is insignificant at other times. We postulate that the erosion potential at a given bedrock elevation datum is proportional to the total duration of sea-level occupation at that datum. The total duration of sea-level occupation depends strongly on rock uplift rate. Certain rock uplift rates may promote the generation and preservation of particular terraces while others prevent them. For example, at rock uplift of ~1.2 mm/yr, the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e (ca. 120 ka) high stand reoccupies the elevation of the MIS 6d–e mid-stand, favoring creation of a wider terrace than at higher or lower rock uplift rates. Thus, misidentification of terraces can occur if each terrace in a sequence is assumed to form uniquely at successive interglacial high stands and to reflect their relative elevations. Developing a graphical proxy for the entire erosion potential of sea-level history allows us to address creation and preservation biases at different rock uplift rates.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/101/608088/The-influence-of-rock-uplift-rate-on-the-formation,2023-01-24
"Miocene to modern hydrothermal circulation and high topography during synconvergent extension in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru","The Cordillera Blanca detachment in the highest elevations of the Peruvian Andes has been accommodating synconvergent extension since the late Miocene. Stable isotope analysis of synkinematic mica from its exhumed footwall shear zone provides new constraints on deep meteoric-hydrothermal circulation during ductile deformation and regional paleoelevation. Muscovite and biotite that deformed and/or grew synkinematically in the shear zone have δ2H values of −131‰ to −58‰ and −149‰ to −98‰ (versus Vienna standard mean ocean water, VSMOW), respectively. The δ2H value difference between coexisting muscovite and biotite is consistent with equilibrium fractionation of the same fluid at the same temperature. Calculated δ2H values of water (−107‰ to −78‰) in equilibrium with these micas are indistinguishable from those of present-day, deeply circulated (9–11 km) hot spring waters emanating from the fault. Such low-δ2H fluids indicate circulation of meteoric water to the depths of the brittle-ductile transition that cannot be explained by other mechanisms. Average recharge paleoelevation for water entering the shear zone based on hydrogen isotopes was 3400 + 500/–700 m (1σ). This is near, but ~500 m below, the present-day mean elevation of the catchments feeding modern hot springs of 3965 ± 880 m, and ~700 m below the 4200 + 700/–900 m mean recharge elevation derived from δ2H values of modern surface and thermal water. The consistency between modern and ancient fault-assisted hydrothermal systems and elevation suggests that high topography, steep relief, and meteoric-hydrothermal circulation have persisted throughout the history of the Cordillera Blanca detachment system.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/106/608435/Miocene-to-modern-hydrothermal-circulation-and,2023-01-24
Lateral variation in slab window viscosity inferred from global navigation satellite system (GNSS)–observed uplift due to recent mass loss at Patagonia ice fields,"The geographic coincidence of the Chile Ridge slab window and the Patagonia ice fields offers a unique opportunity for assessing the effects of slab window rheology on glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Mass loss of these ice fields since the Little Ice Age causes rapid but variable crustal uplift, 12–24 mm/yr around the North Patagonia ice field, increasing to a maximum of 41 mm/yr around the South Patagonia ice field, as determined from newly collected or processed geodetic data. We used these observational constraints in a three-dimensional Maxwell viscoelastic finite element model of GIA response above both the subducting slab and slab window in which the upper-mantle viscosity was parameterized to be uniform with depth. We found that the viscosity of the northern part of the slab window, ~2 × 1018 Pa·s, is lower than that of the southern part by approximately an order of magnitude. We propose that this along-strike viscosity contrast is due to late Cenozoic ridge subduction beneath the northern part of the slab window, which increases asthenospheric temperature and reduces viscosity.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/111/608221/Lateral-variation-in-slab-window-viscosity,2023-01-24
Evidence for enhanced fluvial channel mobility and fine sediment export due to precipitation seasonality during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum,"The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) was the most extreme example of an abrupt global warming event in the Cenozoic, and it is widely discussed as a past analog for contemporary climate change. Anomalous accumulation of terrigenous mud in marginal shelf environments and concentration of sand in terrestrial deposits during the PETM have both been inferred to represent an increase in fluvial sediment flux. A corresponding increase in water discharge or river slope would have been required to transport this additional sediment. However, in many locations, evidence for changes in fluvial slope is weak, and geochemical proxies and climate models indicate that while runoff variability may have increased, mean annual precipitation was unaffected or potentially decreased. Here, we explored whether changes in river morphodynamics under variable-discharge conditions could have contributed to increased fluvial sand concentration during the PETM. Using field observations, we reconstructed channel paleohydraulics, mobility, and avulsion behavior for the Wasatch Formation (Piceance Basin, Colorado, USA). Our data provide no evidence for changes in fluvial slope during the PETM, and thus no evidence for enhanced sediment discharge. However, our data do show evidence of increased fluvial bar reworking and advection of sediment to floodplains during channel avulsion, consistent with experimental studies of alluvial systems subjected to variable discharge. High discharge variability increases channel mobility and floodplain reworking, which retains coarse sediment while remobilizing and exporting fine sediment through the alluvial system. This mechanism can explain anomalous fine sediment accumulation on continental shelves without invoking sustained increases in fluvial sediment and water discharge.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/116/608224/Evidence-for-enhanced-fluvial-channel-mobility-and,2023-01-24
The role of phyllosilicate partial melting in segregating tungsten and tin deposits in W-Sn metallogenic provinces,"Most tungsten (W) and tin (Sn) deposits are associated with highly evolved granites derived from the anatexis of metasedimentary rocks. They are commonly separated in both space and time, and in the rare cases where the W and Sn mineralization are part of a single deposit, the two metals are temporally separate. The factors controlling this behavior, however, are not well understood. Our compilation of whole-rock geochemical data for W- and Sn-related granites in major W-Sn metallogenic belts shows that the Sn-related granites are generally the products of higher-temperature partial melting (~800 °C) than the W-related granites (~750 °C). Thermodynamic modeling of partial melting and metal partitioning shows that W is incorporated into the magma formed during low-temperature muscovite-dehydration melting, whereas most of the Sn is released into the magma at a higher temperature during biotite-dehydration melting; the Sn of the magma may be increased significantly if melt is extracted prior to biotite melting. At the same degree of partial melting, the concentrations of the two metals in the partial melt are controlled by their concentration in the protolith. Thus, the nature of the protolith and the melting temperature and subsequent evolution of the magma all influence the metallogenic potential of a magma and, in combination, helped control the spatial and temporal segregation of W and Sn deposits in all major W-Sn metallogenic belts.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/1/121/608225/The-role-of-phyllosilicate-partial-melting-in,2023-01-24

"Volcanic origin of the mercury anomalies at the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition of Bidart, France","The timing and mechanisms of the climatic and environmental perturbations induced by the emplacement of the Deccan Traps large igneous province (India) and their contribution to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction are still debated. In many marine sediment archives, mercury (Hg) enrichments straddling the K-Pg boundary have been interpreted as the signature of Deccan Traps volcanism, but Hg may also have been derived from the Chicxulub (Mexico) impact. We investigated the Hg isotope composition, as well as the behavior of iridium (Ir) and other trace elements, in K-Pg sediments from the Bidart section in southwest France. Above the K-Pg boundary, Ir content gradually decreases to background values in the Danian carbonates, which is interpreted to indicate the erosion and redistribution of Ir-rich fallouts. No significant enrichment in Ir and W, or Zn and Cu, is observed just below the K-Pg boundary, excluding the hypothesis of downward remobilization of Hg from the boundary clay layer. Positive Δ199Hg and slightly negative values in the upper Maastrichtian and lower part of the early Danian are consistent with the signature of sediments supplied by atmospheric Hg2+ deposition and volcanic emissions. Up section, large shifts to strongly negative mass-dependent fractionation values (δ202Hg) result from the remobilization of Hg formerly sourced by the impactor or by a mixture of different sources including biomass burning, volcanic eruption, and asteroid impact, requiring further investigation. Our results provide additional support for the interpretation that the largest eruptions of the Deccan Traps began just before, and encompassed, the K-Pg boundary and therefore may have contributed to the K-Pg mass extinction.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/2/142/608428/Volcanic-origin-of-the-mercury-anomalies-at-the,2023-01-24

A fragile record of fleeting water on Mars,"The light-toned sedimentary layers that outcrop widely throughout Mars’ Southern Highlands have long been an enigma in uncovering the climatic history of Mars. Although these units seem to contain unique records of fluctuating surface conditions, the role of water in their formation is debated. A distinctive property of many such deposits is their elevated thermal inertia relative to that of surrounding materials. This temperature-controlling trait is often interpreted to indicate induration resulting from aqueous processes. However, prevalent erosional landforms suggest that the deposits host much weaker materials than neighboring units. We address this apparent contradiction by disentangling the relationships between thermal inertia, mineralogy, and erosion susceptibility and by quantifying the cohesion of layered deposits in the Arabia Terra region. We demonstrate that variations in dust cover associated with relative erodibility and eolian abrasion can be inconspicuous controls on apparent thermal inertia. We ultimately find that these deposits are not as cohesive as would be expected from a high water-to-rock ratio setting either during or after deposition. If water-rich surface conditions existed in the region after the Noachian, these deposits suggest they may have only been intermittent and fleeting.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/2/152/608434/A-fragile-record-of-fleeting-water-on-Mars,2023-01-24

Formation of low-gradient bedrock chutes by dry rockfall on planetary surfaces,"Channel-like forms are ubiquitous on steep hillslopes on Earth, Mars, and other planetary bodies. On Earth and Mars, these landforms are commonly attributed to water activity, especially for slopes below the angle of repose (∼30°) where dry granular flows are considered ineffective. While the angle of repose characterizes loose sediment stability, it is unclear whether dry rockfall can traverse and erode channels in bedrock or cemented substrates. We used a large-scale experiment to show that bedrock chutes can form spontaneously at low gradients from dry rockfall. Our results, combined with observations of rocky outcrops and boulders on Mars, indicate that rockfall can be an important bedrock degradation process that can produce low-gradient channels in the absence of water.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/2/174/608429/Formation-of-low-gradient-bedrock-chutes-by-dry,2023-01-24

Identifying crystal accumulation and melt extraction during formation of high-silica granite,"High-silica (>70 wt% SiO2) magmas are usually believed to form via shallow crustal–level fractional crystallization of intermediate magmas. However, the broad applicability of this model is controversial, because the required crystal-melt separation processes have rarely been documented globally up to now. The ca. 50 Ma Nyemo composite pluton of the Gangdese batholith belt in southern Tibet, which comprises intrusive rocks with intermediate- to high-silica compositions (65–78 wt%), offers a unique opportunity for substantiating the coexistence of extracted melts and complementary silicic cumulates in one of Earth's most complete transcrustal silicic magmatic systems. The Nyemo pluton intrusive rocks exhibit similar zircon Hf isotopic compositional ranges (mean εHf(t) = +5.7 to +8.3), suggesting a common, non-radiogenic magma source with crustal assimilation in the deep crust. Yet, these rocks have distinct geochemical characteristics. High-silica miarolitic and rapakivi granites are strongly depleted in Ba, Sr, and Eu, and their zircon trace elements show extremely low Eu/Eu* and Dy/Yb. In contrast, monzogranite is relatively enriched in Ba and Sr with minor Eu anomalies, and the zircon trace elements are characterized by relatively high Eu/Eu* and Dy/Yb. Therefore, we propose that the high-silica granites represent highly fractionated melt extracted from a mush reservoir at unusually low storage pressure (∼99–119 MPa), and that the monzogranite constitutes the complementary residual silicic cumulates.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/2/216/609539/Identifying-crystal-accumulation-and-melt,2023-01-24
Zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology of Grand Canyon resolves 1250 Ma unroofing at the Great Unconformity and <20 Ma canyon carving,"Our study used zircon (U-Th)/He (ZHe) thermochronology to resolve cooling events of Precambrian basement below the Great Unconformity surface in the eastern Grand Canyon, United States. We combined new ZHe data with previous thermochronometric results to model the <250 °C thermal history of Precambrian basement over the past >1 Ga. Inverse models of ZHe date-effective uranium (eU) concentration, a relative measure of radiation damage that influences closure temperature, utilize He diffusion and damage annealing and suggest that the main phase of Precambrian cooling to <200 °C was between 1300 and 1250 Ma. This result agrees with mica and potassium feldspar 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology showing rapid post–1400 Ma cooling, and both are consistent with the 1255 Ma depositional age for the Unkar Group. At the young end of the timescale, our data and models are also highly sensitive to late-stage reheating due to burial beneath ∼3–4 km of Phanerozoic strata prior to ca. 60 Ma; models that best match observed date-eU trends show maximum temperatures of 140–160 °C, in agreement with apatite (U-Th)/He and fission-track data. Inverse models also support multi-stage Cenozoic cooling, with post–20 Ma cooling from ∼80 to 20 °C reflecting partial carving of the eastern Grand Canyon, and late rapid cooling indicated by 3–7 Ma ZHe dates over a wide range of high eU. Our ZHe data resolve major basement exhumation below the Great Unconformity during the Mesoproterozoic (1300–1250 Ma), and “young” (20–0 Ma) carving of Grand Canyon, but show little sensitivity to Neoproterozoic and Cambrian basement unroofing components of the composite Great Unconformity.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/2/222/609355/Zircon-U-Th-He-thermochronology-of-Grand-Canyon,2023-01-24

Pyrrhotite–silicate melt partitioning of rhenium and the deep rhenium cycle in subduction zones,"The Re-Os isotopic system serves as an important tracer of recycled crust in Earth's deep mantle because of the large Re/Os ratios and time-integrated enrichment of radiogenic Os in Earth's crust. However, the Re distribution in Earth's known reservoirs is mass imbalanced, and the behavior of Re during subduction remains little understood. We performed laboratory experiments to determine the partition coefficients of Re between pyrrhotite and silicate melt () at 950–1080°C, 1–3 GPa, and oxygen fugacities (in log units relative to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz [FMQ] buffer) of FMQ–1.3 to FMQ +2. The obtained  values are 200–25,000, which increase with decreasing oxygen fugacity and the total iron content (FeOtot) of silicate melt but decrease with increasing temperature or decreasing pressure. Applying  to constrain the behavior of Re during slab melting demonstrates that slab melts contribute minimal Re to the sub-arc mantle, with most Re dissolved in sulfides subducted into Earth's deep mantle. Deep storage of recycled oceanic basalts and sediments can explain the mass imbalance of Re in Earth's primitive mantle, depleted mantle, and crust.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/2/232/609538/Pyrrhotite-silicate-melt-partitioning-of-rhenium,2023-01-24

Evaluating preservation bias in the continental growth record against the monazite archive,"Most recent models of continental growth are based on large global compilations of detrital zircon ages, which preserve a distinctly episodic record of crust formation over billion-year timescales. However, it remains unclear whether this uneven distribution of zircon ages reflects a true episodicity in the generation of continental crust through time or is an artifact of the selective preservation of crust isolated in the interior of collisional orogens. We address this issue by analyzing a new global compilation of monazite ages (n >100,000), which is comparable in size, temporal resolution, and spatial distribution to the zircon continental growth record and unambiguously records collisional orogenesis. We demonstrate that the global monazite and zircon age distributions are strongly correlated throughout most of Earth history, implying a link between collisional orogenesis and the preserved record of continental growth. Our findings support the interpretation that the continental crust provides a preservational, rather than generational, archive of crustal growth.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/2/243/609540/Evaluating-preservation-bias-in-the-continental,2023-01-24
"Morphologic signatures of autogenic waterfalls: A case study in the San Gabriel Mountains, California","Waterfalls can form due to external perturbation of river base level, lithologic heterogeneity, and internal feedbacks (i.e., autogenic dynamics). While waterfalls formed by lithologic heterogeneity and external perturbation are well documented, there is a lack of criteria with which to identify autogenic waterfalls, thereby limiting the ability to assess the influence of autogenic waterfalls on landscape evolution. We propose that autogenic waterfalls evolve from bedrock bedforms known as cyclic steps and therefore form as a series of steps with spacing and height set primarily by channel slope. We identified 360 waterfalls split between a transient and steady-state portion of the San Gabriel Mountains in California, USA. Our results show that while waterfalls have different spatial distributions in the transient and steady-state landscapes, waterfalls in both landscapes tend to form at slopes >3%, coinciding with the onset of Froude supercritical flow, and the waterfall height to spacing ratio in both landscapes increases with slope, consistent with cyclic step theory and flume experiments. We suggest that in unglaciated mountain ranges with relatively uniform rock strength, individual waterfalls are predominately autogenic in origin, while the spatial distribution of waterfalls may be set by external perturbations.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/2/248/609930/Morphologic-signatures-of-autogenic-waterfalls-A,2023-01-24

Correlative tomography of an exceptionally preserved Jurassic ammonite implies hyponome-propelled swimming,"The extreme rarity of soft-tissue preservation in ammonoids has meant there are open questions regarding fundamental aspects of their biology. We report an exceptionally preserved Middle Jurassic ammonite with unrivaled information on soft-body organization interpreted through correlative neutron and X-ray tomography. Three-dimensional imaging of muscles and organs of the body mass for the first time in this iconic fossil group provides key insights into functional morphology. We show that paired dorsal muscles withdrew the body into the shell, rather than acting with the funnel controlling propulsion as in Nautilus. This suggests a mobile, retractable body as a defense strategy and necessitates a distinct swimming mechanism of hyponome propulsion, a trait that we infer evolved early in the ammonoid-coleoid lineage.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/397/610120/Correlative-tomography-of-an-exceptionally,2023-01-24

Silver isotope and volatile trace element systematics in galena samples from the Iberian Peninsula and the quest for silver sources of Roman coinage,"Silver played a key role in the progressive monetization of early Mediterranean civilizations. We combine Pb and Ag isotopes with volatile trace elements (Bi, Sb, and As) to assess whether, during the Roman occupation of Iberia, galena constituted a significant source of silver. We find that the Pb and Ag isotopic compositions of 47 samples of galena from eight different Iberian mining provinces, many of them exploited during Roman times, are uncorrelated. This indicates that their respective isotopic variabilities depend on different petrogenetic processes. Moreover, the range of Ag isotopic abundances is approximately six times wider than that displayed worldwide by silver coins in general and Roman silver coins in particular. Although galena from the Betics provides the best fit for Pb isotopes with Roman coins, their fit with Ag isotopic compositions is at best sporadic. We suggest that, together with Sb, Bi, and As, silver is primarily derived from fluids boiled off from differentiated mantle-derived magmas. These fluids, in turn, reacted with preexisting galena and functioned as a silver trap. Lead sulfides with ε109Ag of ~0 and unusually rich in Ag, Sb, Bi, and As were the most probable sources of ancient silver, whereas samples with ε109Ag departing significantly from ~0 reflect low-temperature isotopic fractionation processes in the upper crust.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/422/610233/Silver-isotope-and-volatile-trace-element,2023-01-24
"Role of sediment in generating contemporaneous, diverse “type” granitoid magmas","Granite typology categorizes granitoid rocks based upon distinguishing characteristics that are interpreted to indicate sources, conditions of generation, and, by implication, tectonic setting. Complexities of elemental and isotopic geochemistry, however, commonly preclude simple typological interpretation and suggest more complex petrogenetic histories. Granitoids from the Songpan-Ganzi terrane in the eastern Tibetan Plateau were emplaced within a short interval (~15 m.y.). They display mineralogical and geochemical characteristics that are consistent with a wide range of proposed typologies (I-, S-, and A-type; high Ba-Sr and adakitic variants). Despite their close spatial and temporal association, these granitoids exhibit diversity in geochemical characteristics that indicates a broad spectrum of contributing sources. Radiogenic isotope data reveal a continuum from primitive to evolved crustal compositions; i.e., 87Sr/86Sr(t) = 0.704–0.715 and εNd(t) = +2 to −11. All granitoid “types” have variable but commonly high zircon δ18O (+4.1‰ to +11.6‰) and low whole-rock Li-B-Mg isotopic ratios compared to mantle and/or seawater (δ7Li = +5.1‰ to −3.2‰; δ11B = −10.7‰ to −16.5‰; δ26Mg = −0.23‰ to −0.59‰). These stable isotopic compositions suggest that the Songpan-Ganzi granitic magmas of all “types” had contributions from sediment, ranging from minor to dominant. The highly variable isotopic compositions of the granitoids rule out a single homogeneous source for these diverse yet contemporaneous granitoids. Their compositional variability may have been significantly influenced by sedimentary contributions, and these results demonstrate the difficulty of straightforward assignment and interpretation of granitoids using conventional typology.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/427/610230/Role-of-sediment-in-generating-contemporaneous,2023-01-24

Early Earth zircons formed in residual granitic melts produced by tonalite differentiation,"The oldest geological materials on Earth are Hadean (>4 Ga) detrital zircon grains. Their chemistry and apparently low Ti-in-zircon temperatures (≤700 °C) are considered to be inconsistent with crystallization in a magma of the tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suite, although these are the dominant Archean (4.0–2.5 Ga) silicic rocks. Using a new data set of trace element contents in zircons from Paleoarchean Barberton TTGs (South Africa) and thermodynamic modeling, we show that these zircons have crystallized at near-solidus conditions from a compositionally uniform granitic melt. This melt is residual from the crystallization of a less evolved (tonalitic) parent and thereby shows major and trace element compositions different from bulk TTG rocks. A global compilation reveals that most Hadean detrital and Archean TTG-hosted grains share a peculiar zircon trace element signature that is distinct from the chemical trends defined by Phanerozoic zircons. Our model shows that the low Ti contents of early Earth zircons reflect crystallization at higher temperatures (720–800 °C) than initially inferred due to lower modeled TiO2 activity in the melt relative to previous estimates. We therefore propose that near-solidus zircon crystallization from a chemically evolved melt in a TTG-like magmatic environment was the dominant zircon-forming process on the early Earth.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/437/610229/Early-Earth-zircons-formed-in-residual-granitic,2023-01-24

Two-pronged kill mechanism at the end-Triassic mass extinction,"High-resolution biomarker and compound-specific isotope distributions coupled with the degradation of calcareous fossil remnants reveal that intensive euxinia and decalcification (acidification) driven by Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) activity formed a two-pronged kill mechanism at the end-Triassic mass extinction. In a newly proposed extinction interval for the basal Blue Lias Formation (Bristol Channel Basin, UK), biomarker distributions reveal an episode of persistent photic zone euxinia (PZE) that extended further upward into the surface waters. In the same interval, shelly taxa almost completely disappear. Beginning in the basal paper shales of the Blue Lias Formation, a Lilliput assemblage is preserved consisting of only rare calcitic oysters (Liostrea) and ghost fossils of decalcified aragonitic bivalves. The stressors of PZE and decalcification parsimoniously explain the extinction event and inform possible combined causes of other biotic crises linked to emplacement of large igneous provinces, notably the end-Permian mass extinction, when PZE occurred on a broad and perhaps global scale.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/448/610680/Two-pronged-kill-mechanism-at-the-end-Triassic,2023-01-24
Are fluid inclusions in gypsum reliable paleoenvironmental indicators? An assessment of the evidence from the Messinian evaporites,"The paleosalinity of water from which the gypsum precipitated during the Messinian salinity crisis is a controversial issue. Recent microthermometry studies on primary fluid inclusions in gypsum provided very low salinity values not compatible with precipitation from seawater, and suggested strong mixing between seawater and nonmarine waters enriched in calcium sulfate. We applied a new microthermometric protocol on gypsum crystals from nine Mediterranean sections that were experimentally stretched to measure a larger population of fluid inclusions. The results show salinities ranging from 9 to 238 wt‰ NaCl equivalent, largely falling within the evaporation path of normal seawater. The data from previous studies were obtained mostly from those fluid inclusions capable of nucleating a stable bubble after a weak stretching, which probably correspond to those having a lower salinity acquired through post-depositional crack-and-seal processes. Our data suggest instead that the primary gypsum precipitated from a marine brine, later modified by post-trapping processes during tectonics and exhumation.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/454/610676/Are-fluid-inclusions-in-gypsum-reliable,2023-01-24
"A red bole zircon record of cryptic silicic volcanism in the Deccan Traps, India","Silicic magmas within large igneous provinces (LIPs) are understudied relative to volumetrically dominant mafic magmas despite their prevalence and possible contribution to LIP-induced environmental degradation. In the 66 Ma Deccan LIP (India), evolved magmatism is documented, but its geographic distribution, duration, and significance remain poorly understood. Zircons deposited in weathered Deccan lava flow tops (“red boles”) offer a means of indirectly studying potentially widespread, silicic, explosive volcanism spanning the entire period of flood basalt eruptions. We explored this record through analysis of trace elements and Hf isotopes in zircon crystals previously dated by U–Pb geochronology. Our results show that zircon populations within individual red boles fingerprint distinct volcanic sources that likely developed in an intraplate setting on cratonic Indian lithosphere. However, our red bole zircon geochemical and isotopic characteristics do not match those from previously studied silicic magmatic centers, indicating that they must derive from yet undiscovered or understudied volcanic centers associated with the Deccan LIP.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/460/610679/A-red-bole-zircon-record-of-cryptic-silicic,2023-01-24

Using high-precision high field strength element (HFSE) concentrations in magmas from volcanoes in southern Italy, we show that the high Nb/Ta of Etna (up to 26) reveals a mantle source affected by carbonatite metasomatism, which is likely responsible for the large CO2 fluxes. As observed at Etna, carbon-rich mantle domains influence CO2 degassing also outside of continental rifts and therefore play a fundamental role in explaining volcanic CO2 fluxes in different geodynamic settings. Collectively, our study demonstrates that HFSE ratios in magmatic rocks are viable tracers for volcanic carbon degassing that can be used to study present-day settings and, possibly, past emissions.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/486/610900/A-carbon-rich-lithospheric-mantle-as-a-source-for,2023-01-24

"Middle Oxfordian carbon cycle perturbation expressed in the Smackover Formation, Gulf of Mexico","The Middle–Late Jurassic opening of the central Atlantic and proto-Caribbean seaways connecting the Pacific with the Tethys Ocean combined with rising sea level led to a major oceanographic and climatic reorganization conducive to the development of widespread carbonate platforms and diverse reefs. The timing of this shift in carbonate production and opening of the Tethys Ocean is well-constrained from outcrops in Europe and western Asia and marked by a notable positive carbon isotope (δ13C) excursion in the middle Oxfordian Gregoryceras transversarium ammonite Zone, termed “MOxE”. However, the temporal constraints from the western arm of the circum-global seaway through the proto-Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico are not well resolved.

These data are the first record of the MOxE in the Western Hemisphere and provide temporal constraints on the opening of the Gulf of Mexico.

Quantifying volcanism and organic carbon burial across Oceanic Anoxic Event 2,"Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (ca. 94 Ma; OAE2) was one of the largest Mesozoic carbon cycle perturbations, but associated carbon emissions, primarily from the Caribbean large igneous province (LIP) and marine burial fluxes, are poorly constrained. Here, we use the carbon cycle box model LOSCAR-P to quantify the role of LIP volcanism and enhanced marine organic carbon (Corg) burial as constrained by the magnitude and shape of the positive stable carbon isotope (δ13C) excursion (CIE) in the exogenic carbon pool and atmospheric pCO2 reconstructions. In our best fit scenario, two pulses of volcanic carbon input—0.065 Pg C yr–1 over 170 k.y. and 0.075 Pg C yr–1 over 40 k.y., separated by an 80 k.y. interval with an input of 0.02 Pg C yr–1—are required to simulate observed changes in δ13C and pCO2. Reduced LIP activity and Corg burial lead to pronounced pCO2 reductions at the termination of both volcanic pulses, consistent with widespread evidence for cooling and a temporal negative trend in the global exogenic δ13C record. Finally, we show that observed leads and lags between such features in the records and simulations are explained by differences in the response time of components of the carbon cycle to volcanic forcing.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/511/611421/Quantifying-volcanism-and-organic-carbon-burial,2023-01-24
"History of earthquakes along the creeping section of the San Andreas fault, California, USA","Creeping faults are difficult to assess for seismic hazard because they may participate in rupture even though they likely cannot nucleate large earthquakes. The creeping central section of the San Andreas fault in California (USA) has not participated in a historical large earthquake; however, earthquake ruptures nucleating in the locked northern and southern sections may propagate through the creeping section. We used biomarker thermal maturity and K/Ar dating on samples from the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth to look for evidence of earthquakes. Biomarkers show evidence of many earthquakes with displacements >1.5 m in and near a 3.5-m-wide patch of the fault. We show that K/Ar ages decrease with thermal maturity, and partial resetting occurs during coseismic heating. Therefore, measured ages provide a maximum constraint on earthquake age, and the youngest earthquakes here are younger than 3 Ma. Our results demonstrate that creeping faults may host large earthquakes over longer time scales.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/4/516/612167/History-of-earthquakes-along-the-creeping-section,2023-01-24

Ultrahigh-temperature granites and a curious thermal eye in the post-collisional South Bohemian batholith of the Variscan orogenic belt (Europe),"Comprehensive zircon thermometry that takes into account zircon saturation temperatures, Ti-in-zircon measurements, and zircon morphologies and microstructures can provide key information on the thermal evolution of a granite batholith. The Variscan South Bohemian batholith (Germany, Austria, and Czech Republic) comprises a series of granitoid units that intruded between ca. 330 and ca. 300 Ma. We categorize the granitic rocks according to their emplacement temperature into very low temperature (T) (VLT; <750 °C), low T (LT; 750–800 °C), medium T (MT; 800–850 °C), high T (HT; 850–900 °C), and ultrahigh T (UHT; >900 °C). The first stage of batholith formation (ca. 330–325 Ma) is characterized by LT to MT melting of mainly metasedimentary sources driven by their isothermal exhumation. In turn, ca. 322 Ma HT and UHT granites in the southern half of the batholith reveal an ephemeral thermal anomaly in the subbatholithic crust, which is presumably linked to a hidden mafic intrusion. The HT and UHT granites are weakly peraluminous, high-K, I-type rocks. Although sharing some features with A-type granites such as high Zr and rare earth element contents, they differ from classical A-type granites in being magnesian, not enriched in Ga over Al, and having high Ba and Sr contents. A ring structure of ca. 317 Ma MT and/or LT plutons is observed around the HT and/or UHT granite complex and interpreted as an aftermath of the hotspot event. This study is an example of how deep-crustal hotspots, presumably caused by mantle magmatism, can significantly enhance the effects of decompressional crustal melting in a post-collisional setting.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/5/542/611750/Ultrahigh-temperature-granites-and-a-curious,2023-01-24
Final inversion of the Midcontinent Rift during the Rigolet Phase of the Grenvillian Orogeny,"Despite being a prominent continental-scale feature, the late Mesoproterozoic North American Midcontinent Rift did not result in the break-up of Laurentia, and subsequently underwent structural inversion. The timing of inversion is critical for constraining far-field effects of orogenesis and processes associated with the rift's failure. The Keweenaw fault in northern Michigan (USA) is a major thrust structure associated with rift inversion; it places ca. 1093 Ma rift volcanic rocks atop the post-rift Jacobsville Formation, which is folded in its footwall. Previous detrital zircon (DZ) U-Pb geochronology conducted by laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) assigned a ca. 950 Ma maximum age to the Jacobsville Formation and led researchers to interpret its deposition and deformation as postdating the ca. 1090–980 Ma Grenvillian Orogeny. In this study, we reproduced similar DZ dates using LA-ICP-MS and then dated 19 of the youngest DZ grains using high-precision chemical abrasion–isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS). The youngest DZ dated by CA-ID-TIMS at 992.51 ± 0.64 Ma (2σ) redefines the maximum depositional age of the Jacobsville Formation and overlaps with a U-Pb LA-ICP-MS date of 985.5 ± 35.8 Ma (2σ) for late-kinematic calcite veins within the brecciated Keweenaw fault zone. Collectively, these data are interpreted to constrain deposition of the Jacobsville Formation and final rift inversion to have occurred during the 1010–980 Ma Rigolet Phase of the Grenvillian Orogeny, following an earlier phase of Ottawan inversion. Far-field deformation propagated >500 km into the continental interior during the Ottawan and Rigolet phases of the Grenvillian Orogeny.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/5/547/611748/Final-inversion-of-the-Midcontinent-Rift-during,2023-01-24

"Reconciling persistent sub-zero temperatures in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, with Neogene dynamic marine ice-sheet fluctuations","In the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica, periodic large-scale marine ice-sheet fluctuations since the mid-Miocene are recorded by drill core and seismic data, revealing a dynamic ice-sheet response to past increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2. In the adjacent, predominantly ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), preserved terrestrial landscapes reflect persistent cold conditions and have been interpreted as indicators of a stable polar ice sheet, implying that the Antarctic Ice Sheet was largely insensitive during past warm periods. These disparate data-based perspectives highlight a long-standing debate around the past stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, with direct implications for the future ice-sheet response to ongoing climate warming. We reconcile marine records of dynamic ice-sheet behavior and episodic open-marine conditions with nearby ancient terrestrial landscapes recording consistent cold-polar conditions. Coupled ice-sheet and regional climate models nested at a high resolution are used to investigate surface temperatures in the MDVs during past warm periods. We find that high-elevation regions of the MDVs remain below freezing even when ice-free conditions prevail in the nearby Ross Sea. We compare observed landscapes with the spatial extent of modeled persistent cold conditions required for preservation of these ancient features, demonstrating that frozen MDVs landscapes could have coexisted with receded or collapsed ice sheets during past warm periods.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/5/557/611749/Reconciling-persistent-sub-zero-temperatures-in,2023-01-24
Implications for Ediacaran biological evolution from the ca. 602 Ma Lantian biota in China,"The morphologically differentiated benthic macrofossils of algae and putative animal affinities of the Lantian biota in China represents the oldest known Ediacaran macroscopic eukaryotic assemblage. Although the biota provides remarkable insights into the early evolution of complex macroeukaryotes in the Ediacaran, the uncertainty in its age has hampered any robust biological evaluation. We resolve this issue by applying a petrographic-guided rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) organic-bearing sedimentary unit study on the Lantian biota. This work confines a minimum age for the first appearance of the Lantian biota to 602 ± 7 Ma (2σ, including decay constant uncertainty). This new Re-Os date confirms that the Lantian biota is of early–mid Ediacaran age and temporally distinct from the typical Ediacaran macrobiotas. Our results indicate that the differentiation and radiation of macroscopic eukaryotes, and the evolution of the primitive, erect epibenthic ecosystem, occurred in the early–mid Ediacaran and were associated with highly fluctuating oceanic redox conditions. The radiogenic initial 187Os/188Os ratios derived from the Lantian (1.14 ± 0.02) and other Ediacaran shales invoke oxidative weathering of upper continental crust in the early–middle Ediacaran, which may have stimulated the evolution of life and oceanic-atmospheric oxygenation. Integrated with published Ediacaran chronological and geochemical data, our new Re-Os geochemical study of the Lantian black shale provides a refined, time-calibrated record of environment and eukaryote evolution during the Ediacaran.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/5/562/611752/Implications-for-Ediacaran-biological-evolution,2023-01-24
Coriolis effect recorded in Late Pleistocene Marine Isotope Stage 5e Bahamian aeolianites,"The windward islands of the Lucayan Archipelago (Bahamas) form an Atlantic Ocean–facing transect spanning >950 km in length and 6° of latitude. The islands' topography is largely constructed from carbonate wind-blown dunes (i.e., aeolianites) deposited during the interglacial phases of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. New digital elevation data from satellite radar interferometry (TanDEM-X German Earth observation satellite) enables a step change in the ability to map and quantify Bahamian aeolian landforms across the archipelago. A semi-automated mapping approach that leverages object-based image analysis yields a total aeolianite area of ~1674 km2 across Great Abaco, Eleuthera, Cat, San Salvador, Long, Crooked, Acklins, and Mayaguana islands (Bahamas) and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Longitudinal axis measurements from 747 Pleistocene parabolic dunes record increasing consistency of east-west orientation with decreasing latitude. Three U.S. National Data Buoy Center data buoys provided modern wind direction and velocity measurements (n = 730,933 of each) along this transect. Analysis of wind vectors (>P90 [90th percentile], n = 70,095) demonstrates increasing organization of easterlies at southern latitudes and an offset in directionality compared to formational winds of Pleistocene Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e deposits. Southward trends of increasing wind strength and consistency reflect geostrophic flow driven by atmospheric circulation within the Hadley cell and right-hand deflection of the Coriolis effect in the Northern Hemisphere. We propose that the offset in directionality between dune axes and modern wind vectors is related to changes in latitudinal width of the Hadley cell from the Late Pleistocene (MIS 5e) to today. This data set is robust enough to serve as a benchmark against which future atmospheric circulation models can be compared.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/5/567/611745/Coriolis-effect-recorded-in-Late-Pleistocene,2023-01-24
Reassessment of ocean paleotemperatures during the Late Ordovician,"The Late Ordovician is a paradox, with a greenhouse climate shifting to an icehouse climate during a time of presumably high CO2 levels. We used clumped isotope (Δ47) microanalysis of fossil brachiopod shells to determine paleotemperatures of North America (Cincinnati Arch) during the Katian (453–443 Ma). Microanalyses of fossil brachiopods yielded a right-skewed distribution of clumped isotope temperatures [T(Δ47)] ranging from 25 °C to 55 °C with a mode of 32 °C and a mean of 36 °C. To test the impact of Δ47 reordering (reequilibration of 13C-18O bonding) at burial temperatures on T(Δ47), we applied a Monte Carlo simulation to a Δ47 reordering model based on the burial history. Because the reordering simulation indicated partial reordering, we used the simulation results to back-calculate T(Δ47) and correct the reordering effect. Correcting for reordering decreased the mean T(Δ47) by only ~1 °C, to 35 °C, and did not change the mode (32 °C). These temperatures are lower than those of previous studies, but still suggest that the Late Ordovician climate of the Cincinnati Arch was warmer than the modern subtropical seas. However, carbonate facies in these strata argue for upwelling of cool water; thus, typical subtropical surface waters may have been as warm as 35 °C approaching the Hirnantian glaciation. Seawater δ18O values derived from back-calculated T(Δ47) and brachiopod δ18O values average −0.3‰ ± 0.6‰ relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water (VSMOW), consistent with the value expected for subtropical surface waters in a greenhouse Earth, assuming a constant seawater-δ18O model.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/5/572/611747/Reassessment-of-ocean-paleotemperatures-during-the,2023-01-24

"Oligocene onset of uplift and inversion of the Cascadia forearc basin, southern Oregon Coast Range, USA","An extensive detrital zircon U-Pb data set (n = 6324 dates) from Eocene to Miocene sandstones and modern river sands establishes the onset of arc magmatism and forearc uplift along the Cascadia convergent margin in southwestern Oregon (United States). Middle to late Eocene marine strata in the Coos Bay area were primarily sourced from the Klamath Mountains and coeval Clarno-Challis volcanoes in central Oregon and/or Idaho. Ancestral Cascades arc magmatism initiated at 40 Ma and supplied sediment to a broad forearc basin in western Oregon during late Eocene time. Major reduction of Ancestral Cascades arc (40–12 Ma) and Clarno-Challis (52–40 Ma) zircon in the Tunnel Point Sandstone (ca. 33–30 Ma) records the isolation of the Coos Bay area from the Ancestral Cascades arc due to Oligocene onset of forearc uplift, basin inversion, and emergence of the southern Oregon Coast Range. The Tarheel formation (ca. 18–15 Ma) is characterized by disappearance of Ancestral Cascades arc zircon and a substantial increase in Clarno-Challis zircon recycled from underlying forearc strata. The ~15–20 m.y. delay between subduction initiation (ca. 49–46 Ma) and the onset of forearc uplift (ca. 33–30 Ma) supports insights from thermomechanical models that identify tectonic underplating and thermally activated lower-crustal flow as major drivers of deformation and uplift in active forearc regions.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/5/603/612162/Oligocene-onset-of-uplift-and-inversion-of-the,2023-01-24

"Shallow distributed faulting in the Imperial Valley, California, USA","In the tectonically complex Imperial Valley, California (USA), the Imperial fault (IF) is often considered to be the primary fault at the U.S.-Mexico border; however, its strain partitioning and interactions with other faults are not well understood. Despite inferred evidence of other major faults (e.g., seismicity), it is difficult to obtain a holistic view of this system due to anthropogenic surface modifications. To better define the structural configuration of the plate-boundary strain in this region, we collected high-resolution shallow seismic imaging data in the All American Canal, crossing the Imperial, Dixieland, and Michoacán faults. These data image shallow (<25 m) structures on and near the mapped trace of the Imperial fault, as well as the Michoacán fault and adjacent stepover. Integration of our data with nearby terrestrial cores provides age constraints on Imperial fault deformation. These data suggest that the Michoacán fault, unmapped in the United States, is active and likely produces dynamic or off-fault deformation within its stepover to the Dixieland fault. Together, these data support more strain partitioning than previously documented in this region.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/5/626/612425/Shallow-distributed-faulting-in-the-Imperial,2023-01-24

Nanoscale isotopic evidence resolves origins of giant Carlin-type ore deposits,"The western North American Great Basin's Carlin-type deposits represent the largest accumulation of gold in the Northern Hemisphere. The controversy over their origins echoes the debate between Neptunists and Plutonists at the birth of modern geology: were the causative processes meteoric or magmatic? Sulfur isotopes have long been considered key to decoding metal cycling in the Earth's crust, but previous studies of Carlin-type pyrite lacked the spatial resolution to quantify differences among the numerous generations of sulfide mineralization. We developed a new dual-method, nanoscale approach to examine the fine-grained ore pyrite. The δ34S of the ore pyrite varies systematically with Au concentration at the nanoscale, indicating that both magmatic and meteoric fluids contributed during mineralization, but the magmas brought the gold. Repeated oscillations in fluid ratios upgraded the metal content, resulting in high gold endowment. Our results demonstrate that high-spatial-resolution studies are key to elucidate the spatiotemporal evolution of complex hydrothermal systems.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/6/660/612794/Nanoscale-isotopic-evidence-resolves-origins-of,2023-01-24

Millennial pulses of ore formation and an extra-high Tibetan Plateau,"Quantifying the rhythms and rates of magmatic-hydrothermal systems is critical for a better understanding of their controls on ore formation and the dynamics of magmatic reservoirs that feed them. We reconstructed the evolution of ore-forming fluids using hydrothermal quartz from the 17.4 Ma Zhibula skarn, Tibet. Ion probe analysis reveals sharp and dramatic changes in quartz δ18O values between 5‰ and −9.3‰, with fluid δ18O values varying between 2.8‰ and −18.2‰, which are best explained by transient meteoric water incursion into a hydrothermal system dominated by magmatic fluids. Two pulses of magmatic fluids and a meteoric water incursion event are inferred, which operated at the millennium scale (760−1510 yr) as constrained by the aluminum diffusion chronometer. Our results indicate that magmatic reservoirs are likely water unsaturated for most of their lifetime (>105−106 yr), with transient and episodic fluid exsolutions (~103 yr) being driven by magma replenishment or crystallization-induced water saturation. With focused and efficient metal deposition, multiple pulses of metalliferous fluids favor the formation of giant deposits with high grade. Meteoric water δ18O values (−25.4 ± 2.3‰) derived from Zhibula quartz further suggest a paleo-elevation of 5.9 ± 0.3 km; this transient early Miocene surface uplift plausibly was due to break-off of the oceanic slab attached to the Indian Plate. Our research highlights that ubiquitous hydrothermal quartz in orogenic belts can probe the dynamics of magmatic-hydrothermal systems and also quantify paleo-elevations, which has significant tectonic implications.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/6/665/612421/Millennial-pulses-of-ore-formation-and-an-extra,2023-01-24
Groundwater seepage is a key driver of theater-headed valley formation in limestone,"Groundwater seepage leads to the formation of theater-headed valleys (THVs) in unconsolidated sediments. In bedrock, the role of groundwater in THV development remains disputed. Here, we integrate field and remote-sensing observations from Gnejna Valley (Maltese Islands) with numerical modeling to demonstrate that groundwater seepage can be the main driver of THV formation in jointed limestone overlying clays. The inferred erosion mechanisms entail (1) widening of joints and fractures by fluid pressure and dissolution and (2) creeping of an underlying clay layer, which lead to slope failure at the valley head and its upslope retreat. The latter is slower than the removal of the talus by creep and sliding on the valley bed. The location and width of THVs are controlled by the location of the master fault and the extent of the damage zone, respectively. The variability of seepage across the fault zone determines the shape of the valley head, with an exponential decrease in seepage away from the fault giving rise to a theater-shaped head that best matches that of Gnejna Valley.

An example of a large, asymmetric mounded drift in Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sediments from northwestern Australia","Clinoforms and clinothems are ubiquitous in shallow marine and shelf margin environments, where they show remarkable seaward progradation trends. Consensus holds that these features do not form in deepwater settings. This study describes an example of a large, asymmetric mounded deposit formed in Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sediments along the Exmouth Plateau (offshore northwestern Australia). Although it formed in deepwater environments, the deposit has previously been interpreted to reflect either a deltaic or shelf margin system based on clinoform and clinothem geometries. We support that this deposit shares similarities with a delta drift that evolved into a large, mounded drift (~180 km in length, ~120 km in width, and up to ~1.7 km in sedimentary thickness) that exhibits two migration trends: one westward and the other northeastward. Three evolutionary phases are proposed: (1) an onset drift stage (ca. 146.5–143.5 Ma); (2) a growth drift stage (ca. 143.5–138.2 Ma); and (3) a burial stage (ca. 138.2 Ma), which marks the completion of the drift and a shift in depositional style. The drift asymmetry and clinoform orientations indicate the influence of a northward-flowing water mass with two main cores. Our analysis thus suggests that bottom currents can create complex deposits with geometries that resemble clinothems in deepwater environments.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/6/741/612786/Can-deepwater-bottom-currents-generate-clinothems,2023-01-24
"Looking upstream with clumped and triple oxygen isotopes of estuarine oyster shells in the early Eocene of California, USA","The δ18O of carbonate minerals that formed at Earth's surface is widely used to investigate paleoclimates and paleo-elevations. However, a multitude of hydrologic processes can affect δ18O values, including mixing, evaporation, distillation of parent waters, and carbonate growth temperatures. We combined traditional carbon and oxygen isotope analyses with clumped (Δ47) and triple oxygen isotopes (Δ′17O) analyses in oyster shells (Acutostrea idriaensis) of the Goler Formation in southern California (USA) to obtain insights into surface temperatures and δ18O values of meteoric waters during the early Eocene hothouse climate. The Δ47-derived temperatures ranged from 9 °C to 20 °C. We found a correlation between the δ18O of growth water (δ18Ogw) (calculated using Δ47 temperatures and δ18O of carbonate) and the δ13C values of shells. The Δ′17O values of shell growth waters (0.006‰–0.013‰ relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water–standard light Antarctic precipitation [VSMOW-SLAP]) calculated from Δ′17O of carbonate (−0.087‰ to −0.078‰ VSMOW-SLAP) were lower than typical meteoric waters. These isotopic compositions are consistent with oyster habitation in an estuary. We present a new triple oxygen isotope mixing model to estimate the δ18O value of freshwater supplying the estuary (δ18Ofw). The reconstructed δ18Ofw of −11.3‰ to −14.7‰ (VSMOW) is significantly lower than the δ18Ogw of −4.4‰ to −9.9‰ that would have been calculated using “only” Δ47 and δ18O values of carbonate. This δ18Ofw estimate supports paleogeographic reconstructions of a Paleogene river fed by high-elevation catchments of the paleo–southern Sierra Nevada. Our study highlights the potential for paired Δ47 and Δ′17O analyses to improve reconstructions of meteoric water δ18O, with implications for understanding ancient climates and elevations.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/755/612992/Looking-upstream-with-clumped-and-triple-oxygen,2023-01-24
Apparent preservation of primary foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios and Mg-banding in recrystallized foraminifera,"Trace element and δ18O values of foraminifera are widely used to reconstruct oceanic temperatures throughout the Cenozoic and beyond. Previous work evaluating the geochemistry of foraminifera with differing degrees of physical preservation have shown that Mg/Ca and δ18O paleothermometers give discrepant values in recrystallized tests, with planktonic oxygen isotopes often yielding significantly lower temperatures than Mg/Ca ratios. To study the mobility of elements during diagenesis, we performed microspatial trace element analyses in Eocene Morozovella. Element maps show that trace element banding is readily identifiable and preserved, to an extent, in texturally recrystallized tests. A reaction-diffusion model was used to test whether the preservation of Mg-banding and the decoupling of δ18O and Mg/Ca values could be the result of diffusively limited “closed-system” recrystallization. Results show that, in a closed system, internal features (such as Mg-banding) will dissipate prior to changes in bulk Mg/Ca composition, while the bulk δ18O value will typically change faster than Mg/Ca. This is observed regardless of what partitioning coefficient is used for Mg and demonstrates that the planktonic Mg/Ca proxy is more diagenetically robust than the δ18O proxy. Thus, this model can explain the observed decoupling of these two proxies. Furthermore, the preservation of intra-test Mg-banding shows potential for use in evaluating the preservation of primary Mg/Ca values and hence the accuracy of paleotemperature reconstructions.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/760/613057/Apparent-preservation-of-primary-foraminiferal-Mg,2023-01-24
Fluid inclusion evidence for extreme overpressure induced by gas generation in sedimentary basins,"Formation and preservation of extremely high-pressure fluid in sedimentary basins is critical to understanding petroleum accumulation and basin evolution; however, this issue remains poorly understood due to a lack of key evidence. We present fluid inclusion evidence from the Paleozoic black shales in the eastern Sichuan Basin (South China block) that suggest that gas generation can form methane-saturated fluids with pressures significantly exceeding the lithostatic pressure. The fluid inclusion internal pressure is so high (e.g., ~77 MPa) that gas hydrate formed at ambient temperature, aqueous-vapor homogenization could not be achieved under ambient pressure, and the homogenization pressure was beyond the scope of the current equation of state for the NaCl-H2O-CH4 system. We infer that the formation of high-pressure (e.g., >230 MPa), methane-saturated fluids induces hydrofracture under weak compressional tectonic regimes, where the excess lithostatic fluids can be accumulated and sustained. Fluid inclusion records with an abnormally high magnitude of overpressure indicate small differential stress and thus can serve as a microscale indicator for tectonic quiescence.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/765/612996/Fluid-inclusion-evidence-for-extreme-overpressure,2023-01-24

Infaunalization and resource partitioning during the Mesozoic marine revolution,"Infaunalization has been regarded as representing a response to increased predation pressures and is therefore central to the Mesozoic marine revolution, which gives pre-eminence to the role that enemy-directed evolution has played as a driving force of biotic change. Our ichnologic compilation from 39 Middle Triassic to Late Jurassic shallow-marine siliciclastic units allows us to evaluate the vertical partitioning of the infaunal ecospace through the application of the ichnoguild concept. This study shows that infaunal communities experienced a marked increase in ecospace utilization during the Early Jurassic, reaching a plateau during the rest of the Jurassic. This trend is expressed by an increase in the maximum number of ichnoguilds per community and per tier and in the number of ichnotaxa per ichnoguild. This pattern shows important partitioning of the infaunal ecospace into a series of tiers and that several organisms were able to exploit the same resources available at discrete sediment zones below the sea bottom. The increase in the maximum number of ichnoguilds per community and per tier suggests that niche partitioning was a key factor in a more efficient use of the infaunal ecospace and in driving alpha diversity. However, the increase in the number of ichnotaxa per ichnoguild indicates that ichnoguilds were packed with organisms exploiting similar resources, arguing against the role of competitive exclusion in structuring communities. Because several episodes of predation increase took place during the Mesozoic, an unequivocal link between predation pressures and infaunalization cannot be demonstrated empirically.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/786/612997/Infaunalization-and-resource-partitioning-during,2023-01-24

Oxygen isotope evidence for progressively assimilating trans-crustal magma plumbing systems in Iceland,"The oxygen isotope composition of mantle-derived melts can place important constraints on how magmas are processed as they traverse the crust. Assimilation of crustal material is a crucial aspect of basalt petrogenesis, as it affects the chemical and rheological characteristics of eruptive magmas at active volcanoes. We report oxygen isotope (δ18O) and trace element (TE) data from a suite of well-characterized basaltic melt inclusions and groundmass glasses from the Bárðarbunga volcanic system in Iceland to assess how and where in the plumbing system crustal rocks interact with ascending magmas. While both melt inclusions and groundmass glasses record a large range in δ18O values (+3.2‰ to +6.4‰ and +2.6‰ to +5.5‰, respectively) groundmass glasses record lower values on average. Relationships between incompatible trace element (e.g., Zr/Nb) and oxygen isotope ratios are best explained with three-component mixing, where primary melts derived from depleted and enriched mantle components with distinct δ18O values mix and acquire a low-δ18O character upon progressive contamination with altered Icelandic crust. The majority (60%) of melt inclusions require 10–30% exchange of oxygen with the Icelandic crust. In addition, for the first time, we link the extent of oxygen isotope exchange with melt equilibration depths, showing that most of the contamination occurs at 1–2 kbar (3–7 km depth). We propose that a progressively assimilating, multi-tiered plumbing system is a characteristic feature of the Bárðarbunga volcanic system, whereby chemical modifications resulting from interaction with the crust systematically increase as melts migrate through higher crustal levels. We show that similar processes may also occur across the active rift zone in Iceland.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/796/612994/Oxygen-isotope-evidence-for-progressively,2023-01-24

"Atypical landslide induces speedup, advance, and long-term slowdown of a tidewater glacier","Atmospheric and oceanic warming over the past century have driven rapid glacier thinning and retreat, destabilizing hillslopes and increasing the frequency of landslides. The impact of these landslides on glacier dynamics and resultant secondary landslide hazards are not fully understood. We investigated how a 262 ± 77 × 106 m3 landslide affected the flow of Amalia Glacier, Chilean Patagonia. Despite being one of the largest recorded landslides in a glaciated region, it emplaced little debris onto the glacier surface. Instead, it left a series of landslide-perpendicular ridges, landslide-parallel fractures, and an apron of ice debris—with blocks as much as 25 m across. Our observations suggest that a deep-seated failure of the mountainside impacted the glacier flank, propagating brittle deformation through the ice and emplacing the bulk of the rock mass below the glacier. The landslide triggered a brief downglacier acceleration of Amalia Glacier followed by a slowdown of as much as 60% of the pre-landslide speed and increased suspended-sediment concentrations in the fjord. These results highlight that landslides may induce widespread and long-lasting disruptions to glacier dynamics.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/806/613387/Atypical-landslide-induces-speedup-advance-and,2023-01-24

"Cenozoic sediment bypass versus Laramide exhumation and erosion of the Eagle Ford Group: Perspective from modelling of organic and inorganic proxy data (Maverick Basin, Texas, USA)","The Cenozoic unconformity above the Late Cretaceous carbonates within the Maverick Basin is a unique feature of Texas (USA). Hypotheses accounting for the unconformity include (1) Cenozoic sediment bypass, and (2) ~6400 m of erosion during the Laramide orogeny. Both hypotheses have different implications for the burial history of the Eagle Ford Group (EFG) and for our understanding of the Laramide orogeny. We generated clumped isotope data and organic maturation proxies from the same location. Carbonate clumped isotope temperatures obtained (113 ± 9 °C) represent recrystallization during burial and a minimum estimate of the maximum burial temperature. This constraint is significantly warmer than apparent organic temperatures derived using an Arrhenius equation (40–55 °C). Organic matter transformation and carbonate recrystallization respond to temperature over different time scales and therefore capture snapshots of the thermal history particular to the chemical reactions that control the respective processes. Using numerical forward modeling on the combination of two different temperature proxies, we derived a new hypothesis: ~2800 m of Cenozoic sediments were accumulated and then eroded during late Laramide compression. This is significantly less erosion than previous estimates, indicating the impact of the Laramide orogeny in the basin may have been less severe than previously thought.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/817/613053/Cenozoic-sediment-bypass-versus-Laramide,2023-01-24

Plate tectonic–like cycles since the Hadean: Initiated or inherited?,"Interpretation of Earth's oldest preserved crustal archive, the Jack Hills zircon of Western Australia, has been controversial in terms of the onset of plate tectonics. We conduct time-series analysis on hafnium isotopes of the Jack Hills zircon and reveal an array of statistically significant cycles that are reminiscent of plate-tectonic subduction. At face value, such cycles may suggest early Earth conditions similar to those of today—the uniformitarian hypothesis that plate tectonics was essentially operational since “day one”. On the other hand, in the context of expected secular changes due to planetary evolution and geological observations, the cycles could instead imply that modern plate-tectonic subduction inherited mantle convective harmonics already facilitated by an early phase of stagnant-lid delamination—the “lid-to-plates” hypothesis. Either way, any model for the nature of plate tectonics must incorporate conditions operating during Hadean time, either by initiation of plate tectonics then or by later inheritance of preexisting cycles of mantle convection.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/827/613386/Plate-tectonic-like-cycles-since-the-Hadean,2023-01-24

Oceanic isostasy as a trigger for the rift-to-drift transition,"A long-standing missing link in our understanding of the Wilson cycle is how a continental rift transitions to seafloor spreading. The variety of rift structures and transition timings at rift margins do not easily lend themselves to some specific degree of strain and/or magmatism as the tipping point. Invariably ignored in the process, but a potential key to the conundrum, is the isostatic response that comes with ocean loading during and after inundation. Ocean mass redistribution on variably subsiding crust drives flow in the asthenosphere in much the same way a growing icecap drives a corresponding outward mantle flow. This flow alters mantle tractions of the rift system, with disappearance of basal resistance, and even adds a push to the rifting process. Evidence for ocean inundation facilitating self-sustained seafloor spreading is observed in the Atlantic, around the Afar triple junction, and elsewhere, indicating that the ocean should not be considered simply incidental to the creation of oceanic basins.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/7/843/613054/Oceanic-isostasy-as-a-trigger-for-the-rift-to,2023-01-24

Tectonic processes facilitate the subsequent recycling and concentration of these nutrients for continued biospheric utilization.

"Late glacial–Holocene record of Southern Hemisphere westerly wind dynamics from the Falkland Islands, South Atlantic Ocean","The Southern Hemisphere westerly wind belt (SHWW) is a major feature of Southern Hemisphere, midlatitude climate that is closely linked with the sequestration and release of CO2 in the Southern Ocean. Past changes in the strength and position of this wind belt are poorly resolved, particularly across the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, a time period associated with fluctuations in atmospheric temperatures and CO2 levels. We used dust geochemistry, particle size measurements, and paleoecological analyses from a peat sequence in the Falkland Islands, South Atlantic Ocean, to describe changes in the SHWW between 16.0 and 6.5 ka (thousands of years before CE 1950). Wind strength was low at ~51°S before and during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14.9–13.0 ka), intensified between 13.1 and 12.1 ka as atmospheric temperatures increased, and then weakened, reaching a minimum between 12.1 and 10.9 ka during the Early Holocene thermal maximum. Northwesterly air masses became more dominant from 12.0 to 10.2 ka, and wind strength remained low until our record was affected by a storm surge or tsunami ca. 7.8 ka. These data indicate a southward shift in the latitude of the SHWW, from north of 51°S prior to and during the ACR, at ~51°S before the onset of the Holocene, and south of 51°S during the early Holocene thermal maximum. This pattern suggests that the latitude of the SHWW was coupled with atmospheric temperatures through the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/880/613524/Late-glacial-Holocene-record-of-Southern,2023-01-24

Claspers in the mid-Cambrian Olenoides serratus indicate horseshoe crab–like mating in trilobites,"Sexual reproduction represents a fundamental aspect of animal biology, but the diversity of reproductive strategies among early Paleozoic metazoans remains obscure. Direct evidence of reproductive strategies comes from exceptionally preserved egg masses in Cambrian and Ordovician euarthropods such as waptiids and trilobites, but anatomical or behavioral adaptations for mating in these taxa are all but unknown. We demonstrate the presence of functionally specialized appendages in the mid-Cambrian (Wuliuan) Burgess Shale trilobite Olenoides serratus. New material of O. serratus preserves significantly modified and reduced endopodites underneath the seventh thoracic and first pygidial tergites. Comparison with extant euarthropods indicates that these specialized limbs are functional analogs to claspers, which are used by sexually mature males to grasp females prior to or during mating. The claspers in O. serratus were most likely used by the male to hold onto the posterior pygidial spines of the female during amplex, similar to the strategy observed in the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus. The new appendicular data from O. serratus provide the first direct evidence for trilobite sexual dimorphism based on the non-biomineralized ventral anatomy. Our findings illuminate the reproductive biology of trilobites and indicate that complex mating behaviors observed in extant euarthropods originated during the Cambrian explosion.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/897/613523/Claspers-in-the-mid-Cambrian-Olenoides-serratus,2023-01-24
"Multiple phyla, one time resolution? Similar time averaging in benthic foraminifera, mollusk, echinoid, crustacean, and otolith fossil assemblages","Time averaging of fossil assemblages determines temporal precision of paleoecological and geochronological inferences. Taxonomic differences in intrinsic skeletal durability are expected to produce temporal mismatch between co-occurring species, but the importance of this effect is difficult to assess due to lack of direct estimates of time averaging for many higher taxa. Moreover, burial below the taphonomic active zone and early diagenetic processes may alleviate taxonomic differences in disintegration rates in subsurface sediments. We compared time averaging across five phyla of major carbonate producers co-occurring in a sediment core from the northern Adriatic Sea shelf. We dated individual bivalve shells, foraminiferal tests, tests and isolated plates of irregular and regular echinoids, crab claws, and fish otoliths. In spite of different skeletal architecture, mineralogy, and life habit, all taxa showed very similar time averaging varying from ~1800 to ~3600 yr (interquartile age ranges). Thus, remains of echinoids and crustaceans—two groups with multi-elemental skeletons assumed to have low preservation potential—can still undergo extensive age mixing comparable to that of the co-occurring mollusk shells. The median ages of taxa differed by as much as ~3700 yr, reflecting species-specific timing of seafloor colonization during the Holocene transgression. Our results are congruent with sequestration models invoking taphonomic processes that minimize durability differences among taxa. These processes together with temporal variability in skeletal production can overrule the effects of durability in determining temporal resolution of multi-taxic fossil assemblages.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/902/613544/Multiple-phyla-one-time-resolution-Similar-time,2023-01-24

Cenozoic delamination of the southwestern Yangtze craton owing to densification during subduction and collision,"It is widely thought that oceanic subduction can trigger cratonic keel delamination, but the southwestern Yangtze craton (SYC; southwestern China) lost its lower keel during Cenozoic continental collision. The upper mantle beneath the thinned SYC contains its incompletely delaminated keel, which has high-velocity seismic anomalies. Combining geophysical observations with the geochemistry of Eocene mafic potassic lavas derived from the SYC mantle at different depths, we suggest that the deep (~130 km) delaminated lithosphere was more fertile and dense, with low-forsterite (Fo; molar 100 × Mg/[Mg + Fe] = 91.3) and high-δ18O (5.9‰) olivine, than the shallow (~55 km) intact lithosphere (Fo = 94.2; δ18O = 5.2‰), although both were rehydrated and oxidized. The deep keel underwent strong refertilization and densification owing to the addition of Fe-rich basaltic melts during earlier oceanic subduction. Subduction-driven refertilization and subsequent collision-driven cooling caused cratonic keel delamination due to compositional and thermal densification rather than hydration- or oxidation-induced rheological weakening. Our study provides an example of Cenozoic cratonic keel delamination in a collisional orogen and highlights the key roles of compositional and thermal densification in delamination during subduction and collision.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/912/613550/Cenozoic-delamination-of-the-southwestern-Yangtze,2023-01-24

The influence of glacial isostatic adjustment on continental shelf stratigraphic correlation,"Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) imparts geographic variability in the amplitude and timing of local sea-level (LSL) change arising from glacial-interglacial oscillations relative to a global mean signal (eustasy). We modeled how GIA manifests in the stratigraphic record across four shelf-perpendicular transects moving progressively more distal to the Quaternary North American ice complex, subject to varying amounts of GIA during glacial-interglacial cycles. Along each transect, we obtained LSL histories for nine sites between 1 m and 250 m water depth from the output of a gravitationally self-consistent GIA model run from marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 11 to the present. We paired each site's unique LSL history with 50 identical annual sedimentation models to create a library of 400-k.y.-duration synthetic stratigraphic columns (each assuming no tectonics). Comparison of the suite of synthetic stratigraphic columns between transects for a given bathymetric depth reveals latitudinal differences in the stratigraphically determined number, magnitude, and age of glacial-interglacial cycles, as inferred from stratigraphic sequence count, apparent water-depth change, and age of preserved deglacial transgression. We conclude that, for many field locales, extraction of primary information about the number, scale, and duration of pre-Cenozoic glacial-interglacial cycles from continental shelf stratigraphic records near ice sheets demands a deconvolution of the GIA signal.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/923/613547/The-influence-of-glacial-isostatic-adjustment-on,2023-01-24

Extensive evidence for a last interglacial Laurentide outburst (LILO) event,"A catastrophic last interglacial Laurentide outburst (LILO) event approximately 125,000 years ago (125 ka) may have contributed to abrupt climate change during the last interglacial. It has been proposed that this event was an analog of the Holocene 8.2 ka event. We characterize in detail the (1) provenance, (2) timing, and (3) delivery mechanism of a layer of red sediments deposited across much of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean at 125 ka. Our observations provide strong support for the occurrence of a LILO event that was analogous to the 8.2 ka event in all three aspects, and likely surpassed it in magnitude. The freshwater discharge associated with the 125 ka LILO event may explain a series of abrupt global changes, including a reduction of the North Atlantic Deep Water and reinvigoration of the Antarctic Bottom Water. Our findings suggest that the mechanism that triggered the LILO event may be an integral part of the deglacial sequence of events, during which the final collapse of the contiguous Laurentide Ice Sheet took place 3.5–4 k.y. after full interglacial temperature was reached in the middle and high northern latitudes.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/934/613525/Extensive-evidence-for-a-last-interglacial,2023-01-24
"An explosive volcanic origin identified for dark sand in Aeolis Dorsa, Mars","Dark, windblown (eolian) sand on Mars has produced significant geologic effects throughout Martian history. Although local and regional sand sources have been identified, a primary origin, or genesis, for Martian sand has not been demonstrated. This knowledge gap was recently heightened by the discovery of widespread sand motion, implying breakdown of grains to sub-sand sizes. To address the question of sand genesis, we investigated the source(s) of sand in Aeolis Dorsa (AD), the westernmost Medusae Fossae Formation, using comparisons to sand potentially sourced from multiple regions, each connoting a different sand genesis. Our methods included comparison of (1) AD sand mineralogies with those of possible sand source features, and (2) mapped AD sand deposits and inferred emplacement directions with modeled sand deposit locations and transport pathways. The results point to a time-transgressive unit, interpreted as pyroclastic, as a source of dark sand. High-resolution images of this unit reveal outcrops with dark sand weathering out of lithified bedrock. Given the extent of interpreted pyroclastic deposits on Mars, this sand genesis mechanism is likely widespread today and operated throughout Martian history. Whereas this work identified olivine-rich sand, a range of original pyroclastic lithologies would account for the mineralogic variability of dune fields on Mars. These findings can be tested through analyses of other pyroclastic deposits and potentially by data from the NASA Curiosity rover in nearby Gale crater.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/939/613527/An-explosive-volcanic-origin-identified-for-dark,2023-01-24
"Early incubation and prolonged maturation of large ignimbrite magma bodies: Evidence from the Southern Rocky Mountain volcanic field, Colorado, USA","Clusters of early central volcanoes in the mid-Cenozoic Southern Rocky Mountain volcanic field (SRMVF; southwestern Colorado, USA) record sites of initial magmatic focusing that led to assembly of sizable upper-crustal magma bodies capable of generating large ignimbrites. Peak growth at precursor andesitic volcanoes was followed by extended periods (0.5 to >2 m.y.) of reduced eruptive activity during inferred prolonged incubation of the crustal reservoir prior to eruption of ignimbrites at the San Juan magmatic locus, as exemplified by the 5000 km3 Fish Canyon Tuff and associated La Garita caldera. After a magma system became thermally mature and compositionally evolved, additional large ignimbrites could erupt more rapidly from polycyclic calderas. In contrast, incubation times for smaller ignimbrite magmas, as at Crater Lake, Oregon, were briefer than for San Juan systems. Plutonic counterparts to the temporal-compositional assembly of arc-ignimbrite magmas are exemplified by incrementally emplaced granitoid intrusions like the Mesozoic Tuolumne complex in the Sierra Nevada.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/944/613545/Early-incubation-and-prolonged-maturation-of-large,2023-01-24

Recurrent tectonic activity in northeastern Brazil during Pangea breakup: Constraints from U-Pb carbonate dating,"Carbonate U-Pb dating of samples from rift-bounding faults of intracontinental basins in the Borborema province, northeastern Brazil, indicate recurrent tectonic activity during Pangea breakup lasting for >150 m.y. from the Late Triassic to the Paleocene, reactivating inherited strike-slip Neoproterozoic–Cambrian shear zones. Triassic ages indicate that brittle deformation started some 80 m.y. before previously known, most likely related to rifting along the incipient Central Atlantic. The subsequent Cretaceous opening of the South Atlantic caused renewed fault activity during rifting and basin development. Furthermore, recurrent Cenozoic tectonic activity along the rift-bounding faults is indicated, suggesting that structural inheritance of the Neoproterozoic–Cambrian continental-scale Borborema shear zone system has been responsible for accommodation of recurrent tectonic stress from Mesozoic rifting to the present day.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/8/969/613626/Recurrent-tectonic-activity-in-northeastern-Brazil,2023-01-24

Seismic evidence for lithospheric boudinage and its implications for continental rifting,"The continental rifting that precedes the breakup of a continent and the formation of a new ocean basin is one of the key processes of plate tectonics. Although often viewed as a two-dimensional process, rifted margins exhibit significant variations along strike. We document along-strike variations developed during the ca. 200–160 Ma continental rifting that formed the margins of the Gulf of Mexico ocean basin. Rayleigh-wave ambient noise tomography reveals a zone of high and low seismic velocity resembling large scale geologic boudins in the mantle lithosphere of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico margin. These features become progressively less prominent eastward following the transition from a magma-poor to a magma-rich passive margin. We infer that mantle refertilization and thickness of the pre-rift lithosphere control deformation style and the along-strike variations in continental rifting. Our results also suggest that deformation during rifting produces long-lived features that persist long after breakup and, therefore, can be used to study rifted margins globally.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/986/613627/Seismic-evidence-for-lithospheric-boudinage-and,2023-01-24
Triple oxygen isotope evidence for a hot Archean ocean,"Triple oxygen isotope (δ17O and δ18O) values of high- and low-temperature altered oceanic crust and products of basalt alteration experiments were measured to better constrain ocean isotope compositions in deep time. The data define an array of δ18O and Δ′17O (Δ′17O=δ′17O − λRL × δ′18O + γ) values from mantle values toward 1‰ and −0.01‰, respectively, with a λ of ~0.523. The altered oceanic crust data were used to construct a model for estimating δ18O-Δ′17O values of the ancient oceans if the continental weathering flux (FCW) and/or hydrothermal oceanic crust alteration flux (FHT) changed through time. A maximum lowering of 7‰ and 4‰, respectively, is achieved in the most extreme cases. The δ18O value of the ocean cannot be raised by more than 1.1‰. Eclogites from the Roberts Victor kimberlite (South Africa), with a protolith age of 3.1 Ga, have δ18O-Δ′17O values that precisely overlap with those of the modern altered oceanic crust, suggesting that the Archean oceans had similar isotope values as today. Published triple isotope data for Archean cherts show that all samples have been altered to some degree and suggest an Archean ocean surface temperature of ~70–100 °C. An ocean as light as −2‰ is still consistent with our eclogite data and reduce our temperature estimates by 10 °C.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/991/614056/Triple-oxygen-isotope-evidence-for-a-hot-Archean,2023-01-24

Mercury isotopic composition of igneous rocks from an accretionary orogen: Implications for lithospheric recycling,"Mercury (Hg) provides critical information on terrestrial planet formation and evolution due to its unique physicochemical properties and multiform isotopic compositions. Current knowledge of Hg is mainly limited to Earth's surface environments, and the understanding of Hg in the Earth's interior remains unclear. Accretionary orogens are major settings for continental crustal growth and crust-mantle interactions. We studied the Hg concentration and isotopic composition of igneous rocks in the eastern Central Asian orogenic belt, using Hg as a proxy to trace the recycling of surface materials in Earth's lithosphere. Our results show low Hg abundances in mafic through felsic igneous rocks (4.93 ± 4.35 ppb, standard deviation [SD], n = 267). Mafic rocks show slightly lower δ202Hg (−2.9‰ ± 0.5‰, SD, n = 24) than intermediate (−2.4‰ ± 0.8‰, SD, n = 58) and felsic (−1.5‰ ± 0.8‰, SD, n = 185) rocks, indicating a chemical stratification of Hg isotopic composition in the continental crust with isotopically lighter Hg in the lower part and heavier Hg in the upper part. Slightly positive Δ199Hg values are observed in mantle-derived mafic (0.07‰ ± 0.06‰, SD) and intermediate (0.06‰ ± 0.07‰, SD) rocks, which agree well with those reported for marine sediments, indicating the involvement of fluids or melts from the oceanic crust. Larger variations of Δ199Hg values (−0.26‰ to +0.21‰, average: 0.01‰ ± 0.08‰, SD, n = 185) are observed in felsic rocks, further indicating recycling of surface Hg from the marine reservoir via slab subduction (reflected by positive values) plus magmatic assimilation of terrestrial Hg (reflected by negative values). Our study demonstrates that Hg isotopes can be a promising tracer for the chemical dynamics of Earth's lithosphere.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/1001/614060/Mercury-isotopic-composition-of-igneous-rocks-from,2023-01-24

Neodymium isotopes of central Mediterranean phosphatic hardgrounds reveal Miocene paleoceanography,"Understanding the causes of the formation of hardgrounds provides insights on the oceanographic evolution of a basin. Phosphate-rich hardground formation interrupted carbonate ramp deposition in the Mediterranean during the Miocene. We analyzed the εNd record of three central Mediterranean hardgrounds to identify the origin of the phosphate-rich waters that formed them within the frame of Mediterranean Miocene paleoceanographic evolution. The Nd isotopes suggest that eastern Mediterranean deep waters were controlled by runoff, in contrast to Atlantic and Indian Ocean waters. This Nd isotope record attests to the weakening of Mediterranean circulation during the Miocene due to closure of the Indian Gateway. Limited exchange with Atlantic shallow seawater led to long residence times for deep waters in the basin. This record indicates the role of upwelling in formation of phosphate hardgrounds and shows the influence of global climate change and local paleoceanographic conditions.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/1023/614059/Neodymium-isotopes-of-central-Mediterranean,2023-01-24

Gouge fabrics reset by thermal pressurization record stress on faults after earthquakes,"Stress on seismogenic faults provides critical information about how much elastic energy is stored in the crust and released by earthquakes, which is crucial in understanding earthquake energetics and recurrence. However, determining post-earthquake stress states on faults remains challenging because current borehole methods are rarely applicable to damaged fault zone rocks. We applied neutron texture analysis to gouge samples of the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan to infer the stress state after the earthquake. Results indicate that the clay fabric within the principal slip zone is orthogonal to the fault plane, whereas outside the principal slip zone the fabric is predominantly parallel to the bedding-parallel fault plane. We suggest that the clay fabric in the slip zone was first neutralized by the coseismic fluidization caused by thermal pressurization and later re-oriented to the new direction of post-earthquake principal stress. Such stress orientation is consistent with the orientations inferred from core-scale fault slip data and dislocation models constrained from global navigation satellite system displacements. If thermal pressurization is a ubiquitous process during earthquakes, gouge fabrics can be used to help probe the post-earthquake stress state of faults.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/1033/614061/Gouge-fabrics-reset-by-thermal-pressurization,2023-01-24
Protogenetic clinopyroxene inclusions in diamond and Nd diffusion modeling—Implications for diamond dating,"Diamonds are witnesses of processes that have operated in Earth's mantle over more than 3 b.y. Essential to our understanding of these processes is the determination of diamond crystallization ages. These cannot be directly determined on diamond, but they can be calculated using radiogenic isotopic systematics of suitable minerals included in a diamond. This method relies on the assumption that the mineral inclusions were in isotopic equilibrium with the diamond-forming medium. We evaluated the validity of Sm-Nd ages yielded by clinopyroxene inclusions by combining crystallographic orientation analyses and Nd diffusion modeling at the relevant conditions for Earth's cratonic mantle. We investigated the crystallographic orientation relationships (CORs) for 54 clinopyroxene inclusions within 18 diamonds from South Africa and Siberia. Clinopyroxene inclusions in some diamonds showed specific CORs with their hosts, indicating possible syngenesis. Other samples had clusters of clinopyroxene inclusions sharing the same orientation but no specific orientation relative to their hosts, indicating that the inclusions are older than the diamond (i.e., they are protogenetic). Diffusion modeling in the temperature range typical for lithospheric diamonds (900–1400 °C) showed that resetting of the Sm-Nd isotopic system in clinopyroxene grains larger than 0.05 mm requires geologically long interaction with the diamond-forming fluid/melt (>3.5 m.y. at average temperature of ~1150 °C). Depending on inclusion size and temperature regime, protogenetic clinopyroxene inclusions may not fully reequilibrate during diamond-formation events. We suggest that small clinopyroxene inclusions (<0.2 mm) that equilibrated at temperatures higher than 1050–1080 °C may be the most suitable for age determinations.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/1038/614054/Protogenetic-clinopyroxene-inclusions-in-diamond,2023-01-24

Silurian wildfire proxies and atmospheric oxygen,"The earliest evidence of wildfire is documented from two localities: the early mid-Silurian Pen-y-lan Mudstone, Rumney, Wales (UK), and the late Silurian Winnica Formation, Winnica, Poland. Nematophytes dominate both charcoal assemblages. Reflectance data indicate low-temperature fires with localized intense conditions. Fire temperatures are greater in the older and less evolved assemblage. These charcoal assemblages and others, new and previously documented, from the Silurian and earliest Devonian are compared to box models of atmospheric oxygen concentration (pO2). Based on modern charring experiments, these data indicate pO2 is divergent from the broad trends predicted by the COPSE-revisited and GEOCARBSULFOR models. Sustained burns require a minimum pO2 threshold of 16%, or ~0.75 present atmospheric level. This threshold was first met and, our charcoal data indicate, was exceeded in the mid-Silurian and then, later in the Silurian, attained again repeatedly.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/1048/614348/Silurian-wildfire-proxies-and-atmospheric-oxygen,2023-01-24

"Natural levees increase in prevalence in the backwater zone: Coastal Trinity River, Texas, USA","Flood dynamics in low-relief landscapes control the lateral exchange of water and sediment between a river and its floodplain. Locations where these exchanges occur for any given river discharge depend on local bank elevations, which in turn depend on the type of landform present immediately adjacent to the river channel. Our analysis separated landforms bordering a river into six categories: levee, scroll bar, counter point bar, channel-bend cutoff, erosional surface, and inactive surface. Each landform is associated with a different range of elevations. Levees are the highest, and counter point bars and cutoffs are the lowest. Using a combination of lidar-derived measurements of topography and water-surface profiles derived from U.S. Geological Survey gauge data, we show that landforms at the margins of the river change with downstream position on the coastal reach of the Trinity River in the southern United States. The fractions of counter point bars and cutoffs decrease downstream, while the fraction and continuity of levees increase to nearly 100%. This spatial change correlates with downstream reductions in channel-bend migration and deformation, and the measured range in river stage. As a result, the greatest range in bank elevations occurs upstream where variation in river stage is also highest. Meanwhile, the smallest range in bank elevation and river stage exists in the coastal backwater zone. Our analysis indicates that essentially all levees within the backwater zone are overtopped by flow associated with a single river discharge. Moving upriver, the discharge associated with levee-overtopping flow systematically increases. This study highlights the morphodynamic control on coastal river flooding.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/1068/614345/Natural-levees-increase-in-prevalence-in-the,2023-01-24
Epidote U-Pb geochronology and H isotope geochemistry trace pre-orogenic hydration of midcrustal granitoids,"Hydrothermal veins and altered feldspar are evidence for fluid circulation in granitic rocks in the continental crust. The hydrothermal alteration of feldspar affects the deformation behavior of granitoids, especially if it occurs before orogeny. Geochronology can establish the timing of fluid circulation to determine if this fluid-driven alteration plays a role in crustal deformation. Although existing dating techniques cannot be applied to feldspar alteration directly, absolute ages of fluid circulation can be obtained from hydrothermal veins. We combined U-Pb geochronology and hydrogen isotope data (δD) from epidote [Ca2Al2(Al,Fe3+) Si3O12(OH)] to unravel the hydration of post-Variscan granitoids in the Alpine orogen. The recent protocol for epidote U-Pb dating proves for the first time that fluids of meteoric origin infiltrated the granitoids in Permian times by exploiting synrift faults, consistent with the δD values of the epidote-forming fluids. This hydration event caused at least some degree of feldspar hydration and weakening of the granitic rocks ~260 m.y. before their pervasive structural overprint by the Alpine orogeny. The preservation of Permian U-Pb ages despite Alpine orogenic processes confirms epidote as a powerful tool with which to unveil pre-orogenic hydration events in metagranitoids. Our analytical approach broadens insights into the water cycle in the middle continental crust in orogens.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/9/1073/614347/Epidote-U-Pb-geochronology-and-H-isotope,2023-01-24

What controlled the thickness of continental crust in the Archean?,"Exposed continents are one of Earth's major characteristics. Recent studies on ancient ocean volume and exposed landmasses suggest, however, that early Earth was possibly a water world, where any significant landmass was unlikely to have risen above sea level. On modern Earth, the thickness of continental crust seems to be controlled by sea level and the buoyancy of continental crust. Simply applying this concept to the Archean would not explain the absence of exposed continents, and we suggest that a third element that is currently insignificant was important during early Earth: the strength of continental upper crust. Based on the pressure imbalance expected at continent-ocean boundaries, we quantified the conditions under which rock strength controls the thickness of continental crust. With the level of radiogenic heat production expected for early Earth, continents may have been too weak to have maintained their thickness against a deep ocean.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/10/1091/614553/What-controlled-the-thickness-of-continental-crust,2023-01-24

Physical transport of magmatic sulfides promotes copper enrichment in hydrothermal ore fluids,"Loss of magmatic sulfides to the mantle is posited to explain the copper deficit of evolved arc magmas and the depleted Cu/Ag ratio of the continental crust. We address the question of whether saturating sulfides may instead be mechanically entrained with rising magmas, and how this would affect their geochemical fate in the upper crust. Entrainment is plausible considering sulfide wetting properties and settling velocities relative to magma ascent velocities. Entrained sulfide increases the pressure at which magmas become saturated with respect to H-O-S fluids in the upper crust by 10–100 MPa, with the pressure difference increasing with temperature, water content, and oxidation. Bubbles are likely to nucleate on sulfide particles, allowing transfer of S and Cu from the sulfide to the fluid over a small crystallization interval without limitations by diffusion through the silicate melt. This sequence of processes gives magmatic sulfides an active role in ore metal transport and enrichment to form porphyry copper deposits, and may have global implications for crustal Cu budgets.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/10/1101/615409/Physical-transport-of-magmatic-sulfides-promotes,2023-01-24
"Unleashing alkali feldspar: Ra/Th ages and chemical and isotopic constraints on Holocene phonolite magmatism, Canary Islands","Accurately dating phenocrysts in Holocene volcanic rocks poses many challenges but is critical to placing magmatic processes that occur prior to eruption into a temporal frame-work. We dated alkali feldspar (i.e., orthoclase Or10 to Or46) crystals in four young phonolites from the Teide–Pico Viejo volcanic complex, Tenerife (Spain), using (226Ra)/(230Th) isotopes. Partition coefficients of Ra (DRa) and DRa/DBa of feldspars were predicted using an approach based on the lattice strain model, which yielded crystallization ages that overlap or predate known eruption ages for the Lavas Negras (ca. 1 ka), Montaña Blanca (ca. 2 ka), Arenas Blancas (ca. 2–4 ka), and Teide H (ca. 6 ka) phonolites. Crystallization of feldspar may occur up to the time of eruption, with >8 ka crystals also present, possibly suggesting extended magma differentiation times. However, feldspars yielding finite (226Ra)/(230Th) ages are mostly in equilibrium with the groundmass, unlike >8 ka crystals, which were therefore identified as antecrysts/xenocrysts. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of feldspars indicate that crystallization predated late-stage assimilation, affecting 87Sr/86Sr ratios of some melts. The (226Ra)/(230Th) ages also constrain the tempo of phonolite magma evolution on Tenerife. Integration of (226Ra)/(230Th) ages with feldspar major elements, trace elements, and isotopes provides a powerful means for investigating crystallization histories using a dominant mineral that controls the overall magmatic evolution of phonolites on thousand-year time scales.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/10/1106/615123/Unleashing-alkali-feldspar-Ra-Th-ages-and-chemical,2023-01-24

Hydrodynamic invalidation of synformal traps for dissolved CO2,"Reservoirs with the geometry of structural lows trap negatively buoyant fluids, mirroring the way structural highs trap positively buoyant fluids. In both scenarios, lateral flow of reservoir water alters the trapping geometry by causing fluid contacts to tilt. Tilt increases in proportion to hydraulic head gradient increases and the density contrast between the flowing and trapped fluids decreases. Positively buoyant, immiscible supercritical CO2 is at least 20% lighter than typical saline formation waters at CO2 subsurface storage pressures and temperatures, and would experience relatively low tilts, <1°, similar to hydrocarbon fields. On the other hand, CO2-saturated brines are within 1% of the density of CO2-free equivalent brine. This relatively low density contrast creates tilted contacts at much higher angles even at the low hydraulic head gradients that typify deep saline aquifers. For example, a fluid contact with 0.5% density contrast exceeds 2° tilt for hydraulic head gradients of only 15 cm/km. Many large and basin-scale synformal traps are formed with structural dips of just a few degrees and therefore cannot trap CO2 solutions under hydrodynamic conditions. This problem could be overcome by utilization of hydrodynamic traps or appropriately configured structural-stratigraphic traps for CO2 sequestration.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/10/1121/615404/Hydrodynamic-invalidation-of-synformal-traps-for,2023-01-24

Lithium (Li) and its isotopes have great potential in this regard because of the different Li isotopic compositions of recycled marine carbonate and silicate components. We report Li isotopic data from Cenozoic and Mesozoic alkali basalts of the West Qinling orogen in central China. Relative to those for normal basalts, very high δ7Li values (up to +11.2‰) were observed for the Cenozoic alkali basalts, but significantly and systematically lower values (as low as −3.3‰) were estimated for the Mesozoic alkali basalts. Their abnormal Li isotopic compositions, combined with major- and trace-element contents and Sr-Mg isotope ratios, indicate that the Cenozoic and Mesozoic alkali basalts originated from carbonated and silicated mantle sources, respectively, reflecting metasomatism of the mantle by slab-derived carbonate and silicate melts during Paleotethyan oceanic subduction. Interactions of such melts with the mantle peridotite in subduction channels can account for the elemental and isotopic differences of the studied alkali basalts. The present study demonstrates an effective way to distinguish between carbonate and silicate metasomatism in subduction zones by studying Li isotopic compositions of alkali basalts and highlights the prospect of Li isotopes in tracing the deep carbon cycle.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/10/1150/615875/Differentiation-between-carbonate-and-silicate,2023-01-24
New constraints on the source of loess from U/Th-Pb geochronology of detrital multi-minerals,"The origin and provenance of eolian sediments such as loess can potentially reveal paleo-air circulation directions that drive temporal changes in climate. The provenance of these deposits has been mostly assessed by detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and remains debated. Recent studies reveal that constraining sediment provenance using only detrital zircon yields a restricted view of the overall sediment sources, because zircon commonly records high-temperature tectonothermal events and thus only represents a portion of provenance lithologies. We applied a new strategy for constraining the provenance of eolian sediments from the Chinese Loess Plateau—Earth's most extensive loess deposit—by using a multi-proxy (i.e., zircon, monazite and rutile) U/Th-Pb geochronology approach. We show that while zircon U-Pb-Lu-Hf isotopic data cannot conclusively discriminate the potential sources, monazite and rutile grains display dominant U/Th-Pb age peaks in the early Paleozoic, early Mesozoic, and late Cenozoic, mirroring the orogenic episodes of the northeast Tibetan Plateau. Monazite and rutile records also reveal spatial variability in sediment provenance between the western and central parts of the Chinese Loess Plateau, which is potentially affected by dust transport from westerly/northwesterly winds. Our integrated data set provides diagnostic constraints on the dust source, provenance variability, and transportation trajectory of the Chinese Loess Plateau, and highlights the importance of this new approach to provenance study of eolian deposits worldwide.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/10/1156/615873/New-constraints-on-the-source-of-loess-from-U-Th,2023-01-24

Autobrecciation and fusing of mafic magma preceding explosive eruptions,"Bubble and crystal textures evolve during magma ascent, altering properties that control ascent such as permeability and viscosity. Eruption style results from feedbacks between ascent, bubble nucleation and growth, microlite crystallization, and gas loss, all processes recorded in pyroclasts. We show that pyroclasts of the mafic Curacautín ignimbrite of Llaima volcano, Chile, record a history of repeated autobrecciation, fusing, and crystallization. We identified pyroclasts with domains of heterogeneous vesicle textures in sharp contact with one another that are overprinted by extensive microlite crystallization. Broken crystals with long axes (l) >10 μm record fragmentation events during the eruption. A second population of unbroken microlites with l ≤10 μm overprint sutures between fused domains, suggesting the highly crystalline groundmass formed at shallow depths after autobrecciation and fusing. Nearly all pyroclasts contain plutonic and ancestral Llaima lithics as inclusions, implying that fusing occurs from a few kilometers depth to as shallow as the surface. We propose that Curacautín ignimbrite magma autobrecciated during ascent and proto-pyroclasts remained melt rich enough to fuse together. Lithics from the conduit margins were entrained into the proto-pyroclasts before fusing. Autobrecciation broke existing phenocrysts and microlites; rapid post-fusing crystallization then generated the highly crystalline groundmass. This proposed conduit process has implications for interpreting the products of mafic explosive eruptions.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/10/1177/615877/Autobrecciation-and-fusing-of-mafic-magma,2023-01-24

Preserved intercratonic lithosphere reveals Proterozoic assembly of Australia,"The Proterozoic assembly of Australia, the understanding of which is critical for reconstructing Proterozoic supercontinents, involved amalgamation of the West Australian (WAC), North Australian (NAC), and South Australian cratons (SAC). However, the basement between these Archean to early Proterozoic lithospheric blocks is mostly buried beneath younger basins; hence, its composition and age and the timing of Proterozoic assembly remain uncertain. In situ zircon U-Pb-O-Hf analyses of igneous rocks from drillholes that intersected basement beneath the northwestern Canning Basin reveal the presence of a substantial domain of juvenile Proterozoic lithosphere, the Percival Lakes province, between the WAC and NAC. Although isotopically distinct from the neighboring WAC and NAC, the Percival Lakes province is strikingly similar to other juvenile Proterozoic tectonic elements between the WAC, NAC, and SAC. Combining isotope and seismic data, we interpret the Percival Lakes province as part of an ~1700 × 400 km Proterozoic lithospheric domain that lacks evidence of Archean provenance but consists mainly of reworked remnants of Mesoproterozoic oceanic crust that survived WAC-NAC-SAC convergence. The apparent absence of Archean lithosphere between the cratons implies they never directly collided or that complete collision was prevented by impingement of three-dimensional promontories in the converging lithospheric blocks. Instead, the Percival Lakes province and other Proterozoic elements between the WAC, NAC, and SAC consist of oceanic lithosphere extracted from Earth's mantle in the Proterozoic. Our results imply that WAC-NAC convergence was younger than Columbia amalgamation at ca. 1.8 Ga and that Proterozoic Australia formed during the earliest phases of Rodinia assembly at ca. 1.3 Ga.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/10/1202/615944/Preserved-intercratonic-lithosphere-reveals,2023-01-24

Paleoclimates inform on a weakening and amplitude-reduced East Asian winter monsoon in the warming future,"The East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) has significant impacts on the weather and climate, and subsequently on the economy and society, in East Asia during boreal winters, and its projection into the future is scientifically and practically significant. However, projections relying on geological EAWM reconstructions, which can compensate for instrumental record limitations, are still lacking and urgently needed. It is more promising to conduct prediction under the background of not only instrumental but also geological changes in the EAWM. We used grain-size records from four high-resolution, chronologically well-defined loess sections on the Chinese Loess Plateau to represent past EAWM intensity and its amplitudes. Our results show that the EAWM is weaker and has lower amplitudes during warm periods than during cold stages at various time scales. Moreover, instrumental records reveal that the EAWM shows a weak level and reduced interannual amplitudes after the mid-1980s under the context of global warming. We propose that the EAWM will experience long-term weakening and reduced (e.g., interannual) amplitudes under 21st century global-warming scenarios.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1224/616378/Paleoclimates-inform-on-a-weakening-and-amplitude,2023-01-24
"Direct constraints on in situ stress state from deep drilling into the Nankai subduction zone, Japan","Stress state is a long-sought but poorly known parameter on subduction megathrusts and in overlying accretionary wedges in general. We used direct observations made during drilling of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) borehole C0002 to a depth of 3058 m below the seafloor (mbsf) in the Nankai subduction zone of southwestern Japan to constrain in situ pore pressure and stress state in the deep interior of an accretionary wedge for the first time. These data included downhole pressure, active pumping tests, and logging and sample measurements. We found a nearly linear gradient in minimum horizontal principal stress (Shmin) and show that it remained consistently smaller than the vertical stress (Sv), definitively ruling out a thrust-faulting stress regime to at least 3 km depth, and to within ~2 km above the subduction megathrust. At 3000 mbsf, the estimated effective stresses were: Sv = 33 MPa, SHmax = 25–36 MPa, and Shmin = 18.5–21 MPa. We therefore interpret that the stress state throughout the drilled interval, which lies entirely in the hanging wall of the active megathrust, lies in a normal or strike-slip faulting regime (Sv ≥ SHmax > Shmin). Total differential stresses are below ~18 MPa. We conclude that (1) basal traction along the megathrust must be small in order to permit both locking (and frictional sliding at failure) of the décollement and such low differential stresses deep within the upper plate; and (2) although differential stresses may remain low all the way to the plate boundary at ~5000 mbsf, SHmax must transition to become greater than the vertical stress—either spatially below the base of the borehole or temporally leading up to megathrust fault rupture—in order to drive thrust motion along the plate boundary as observed in great earthquakes and in recurring very low-frequency earthquakes and slow-slip events.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1229/616603/Direct-constraints-on-in-situ-stress-state-from,2023-01-24

Extensional mountain building along convergent plate boundary: Insights from the active Taiwan mountain belt,"Late brittle extension is a common feature in orogenic belts, and its role in mountain building processes is still the subject of debate. Its timing relationship with crustal thickening, the building of topography, basin infill, and rock exhumation are of key importance in determining whether it is a major factor in orogenic development or merely causes near-surface secondary effects. We examined this question in relation to the active arc-continent collision of Taiwan, studying its structural evolution by integrating new and critical geochronological results for tensile vein filling of hinterland metamorphic terrane with syn-collision deposition records. Acceleration of rock exhumation and molasse deposition was found to be coeval with the initiation of brittle tensile structures at ca. 1.6 Ma, which was long overdue as continental subduction started well before 6.5 Ma in central to northern Taiwan. The topographic mountain of Taiwan was thus constructed when the upper crust of the thickened orogenic prism turned extensional, as orographic elevation and relief are prerequisites for molasses production. Syn-collisional brittle extension is therefore proposed as a possible facilitator of both augmented extrusive exhumation and the formation of orography.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1245/616374/Extensional-mountain-building-along-convergent,2023-01-24

The northern Hikurangi margin three-dimensional plate interface in New Zealand remains rough 100 km from the trench,"At the northern Hikurangi margin (North Island, New Zealand), shallow slow slip events (SSEs) frequently accommodate subduction-interface plate motion from landward of the trench to <20 km depth. SSEs may be spatially related to geometrical interface heterogeneity, though kilometer-scale plate-interface roughness imaged by active-source seismic methods is only constrained offshore at <12 km depth. Onshore constraints are comparatively lacking, but we mapped the Hikurangi margin plate interface using receiver functions from data collected by a dense 22 × 10 km array of 49 broadband seismometers. The plate interface manifests as a positive-amplitude conversion (velocity increase with depth) dipping west from 10 to 17 km depth. This interface corroborates relocated earthquake hypocenters, seismic velocity models, and downdip extrapolation of depth-converted two-dimensional active-source lines. Our mapped plate interface has kilometer-amplitude roughness we interpret as oceanic volcanics or seamounts, and is 1–4 km shallower than the regional-scale plate-interface model used in geodetic inversions. Slip during SSEs may thus have different magnitudes and/or distributions than previously thought. We show interface roughness also leads to shear-strength variability, where slip may nucleate in locally weak areas and propagate across areas of low shear-strength gradient. Heterogeneous shear strength throughout the depth range of the northern Hikurangi margin may govern the nature of plate deformation, including the localization of both slow slip and hazardous earthquakes.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1256/616548/The-northern-Hikurangi-margin-three-dimensional,2023-01-24

Early accretion and prolonged carbonation of the Pacific Ocean's oldest crust,"Newly formed oceanic crust is altered by seawater and carbonated at low temperatures over poorly defined periods of time. We applied in situ U-Pb dating to investigate 28 carbonate veins from Ocean Drilling Program Hole 801C, which is situated in the oldest Jurassic-age oceanic crust preserved in the western Pacific Ocean. Our results indicate that Pacific Ocean crust began accreting at 192 ± 6 Ma, which is ~25 m.y. earlier than previously recognized. Carbonation peaked at 171 ± 5 Ma and continued at a low rate for more than ~65 m.y. after accretion. Jurassic carbonation rates varied over ~10 m.y. timescales but encompassed a range similar to that observed today. These data suggest that carbonation rates are relatively insensitive to changes in atmospheric CO2, but confirm the longevity of seafloor alteration as a critical control in global volatile cycling.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1270/616594/Early-accretion-and-prolonged-carbonation-of-the,2023-01-24

Quantifying controls on the occurrence of nonmarine fossils,"Although numerous studies have described differential preservation of nonmarine fossils in channel and floodplain facies, quantitative comparisons are lacking. We present measurements of the probability of occurrence of plant, mollusk, and vertebrate fossils in the Campanian Judith River Formation of north-central Montana, USA. The data reveal little difference in the probability of occurrence among higher taxa in channel and floodplain facies, except for plants, which have a higher probability in floodplain deposits. This surprising result supports more recent models in which many organisms are buried initially in floodplain deposits, but those deposits are subsequently exhumed by migrating rivers, and finally buried in those channels. Comparisons across systems tracts revealed intriguing patterns in which plants have a higher probability of occurrence in high-accommodation systems tracts in channel and floodplain deposits, and vertebrates have a higher probability of occurrence in channels of the low-accommodation systems tract. These results confirm that sequence-stratigraphic architecture should be considered in interpretations of the nonmarine fossil record. This probability of occurrence method has promise for many other comparisons of fossilization potential.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1287/616604/Quantifying-controls-on-the-occurrence-of,2023-01-24
Osmium isotopes fingerprint mantle controls on the genesis of an epithermal gold province,"The formation of crustal blocks enriched with gold (Au) deposits above subduction zones is intimately bound to the genesis and evolution of magmatic-hydrothermal systems. A long-standing question, however, is whether the metal fertility of these systems stems from distinct sources that are anomalously enriched in Au or from subsequent processes occurring during crustal magma emplacement and hydrothermal activity. The Deseado Massif auriferous province in southern Patagonia (Argentina) is a unique place to test these contrasting hypotheses because Au-bearing mantle xenoliths indicate the presence of an underlying Au-rich lithospheric mantle reservoir. However, direct geochemical links between the Au-rich mantle source and the formation of the Deseado Massif auriferous province in the overlying crust remain to be established. To address this prominent gap in knowledge, we used sulfide Re-Os geochronology to identify the source of Au at Cerro Vanguardia, the largest low-sulfidation epithermal Au-Ag deposit in the Deseado Massif. Pyrite from high-grade Au quartz veins yielded an isochron age of 147.4 ± 2.9 Ma (mean square of weighted deviates = 1.04, n = 8) and an initial 187Os/188Os ratio of 0.26 ± 0.01, fingerprinting a dominant mantle control for the source of Os and, by inference, the source of Au. Our data provide a unique geochemical linkage between an Au-rich subcontinental lithospheric mantle source and the genesis of epithermal Au deposits, supporting the hypothesis that pre-enriched mantle domains may be a critical factor underpinning the global-scale localization of Au provinces.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1291/616599/Osmium-isotopes-fingerprint-mantle-controls-on-the,2023-01-24

Onset of long-lived silicic and alkaline magmatism in eastern North America preceded Central Atlantic Magmatic Province emplacement,"The White Mountain magma series is the largest Mesozoic felsic igneous province on the eastern North American margin. Previous geochronology suggests that magmatism occurred over 50 m.y., with ages for the oldest units apparently coeval with the ca. 201 Ma Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, the flood basalt province associated with the end-Triassic mass extinction and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. We use zircon U-Pb geochronology to show that emplacement of White Mountain magma series plutons was already underway at 207.5 Ma. The largest volcanic-plutonic complex, the White Mountain batholith, was emplaced episodically from ca. 198.5 Ma to ca. 180 Ma and is ~25 m.y. older than published ages suggest, and all samples we dated from the Moat Volcanics are between ca. 185 Ma and 180 Ma. The Moat Volcanics and the White Mountain batholith are broadly comagmatic, which constrains the age of a key Jurassic paleomagnetic pole. Our data indicate that a regional mantle thermal anomaly in eastern North America developed at least 5 m.y. prior to the main stage of Central Atlantic Magmatic Province flood basalt volcanism and suggest a geodynamic link between the White Mountain magma series and the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1301/616544/Onset-of-long-lived-silicic-and-alkaline-magmatism,2023-01-24

Hematite geochronology reveals a tectonic trigger for iron ore mineralization during Nuna breakup,"Hematite and goethite deposits hosted in banded iron formations (BIFs) in the Pilbara craton (Western Australia) represent one of Earth's most significant Fe reserves; however, the timing and tectonic triggers underpinning deposit genesis remain contentious. Uncertainty in ore genesis stems from a lack of direct age measurements, which could aid in correlating periods of BIF mineralization with tectono-thermal events observed elsewhere. Archean–Paleoproterozoic BIFs in the Hamersley Province host extensive martite–microplaty hematite orebodies that formed at 2.2–2.0 Ga, based on indirect constraints. In contrast, combined hematite in situ U-Pb geochronology and (U-Th)/He thermochronology demonstrate that martite–microplaty hematite ores in the Chichester Range crystallized ca. 1.26–1.22 Ga and underwent cratonic denudation between ca. 0.57 and 0.38 Ga. Nanoscale imaging of dated hematite indicates that U-Th-Pb is lattice bound and not hosted in inclusions. New U-Pb hematite ages overlap with other mineral ages reported at the margins of the Pilbara and Yilgarn cratons (1.3–1.1 Ga), where mineral formation was driven by plate reorganization following breakup of the Nuna supercontinent. This age correlation suggests that a combination of increased orogenic (+diagenetic) and heat (+fluid) generative processes resulting from supercontinent reconfiguration was a key trigger for iron ore formation in the Pilbara craton.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/11/1318/616602/Hematite-geochronology-reveals-a-tectonic-trigger,2023-01-24

Across-strike asymmetry of the Andes orogen linked to the age and geometry of the Nazca plate,"The crest of the Andes—the trace of the highest mountain topography—weaves back and forth, in places near the coastline, in others farther inland. Its position reflects the asymmetric distribution of orogen mass and coincides with asymmetry of orographic precipitation. This coincidence is thought to reflect a primary influence of orographic precipitation on accumulated orogenic mass whereby the more erosive (wetter) side promotes crest migration toward the less erosive (drier) side. However, whether this remains the case after excluding tectonic controls on the size and asymmetry of the wedge is an open question. We assessed relationships between precipitation, erosion rates, and the macromorphology of the Andes. We find that precipitation rates cannot sufficiently explain orogen asymmetry after statistically controlling for the age or dip of the Nazca slab. Slab age and dip are known to primarily affect mountain building in the Andes by impacting stress and strain propagation into the retro-arc region, thus better explaining the position of the mountain chain within the orogenic wedge. Accordingly, using basin-wide erosion rate, topographic, and precipitation data, we find that precipitation possibly influences erosional efficiency in semi-arid Andean landscapes but falls short in explaining the variability of erosion rates in regions of high orographic precipitation. We conclude that the orographic effect cannot change the Andean macromorphology that is set by bottom-up tectonic processes.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/12/1341/617928/Across-strike-asymmetry-of-the-Andes-orogen-linked,2023-01-24
Large-scale lava dome fracturing as a result of concealed weakened zones,"Mechanically weakened alteration zones in lava domes are thought to jeopardize their stability. Such zones can be hazardous when concealed within the dome, either because they formed by subsurface hydrothermal circulation or because they formed on the surface but were subsequently buried by renewed lava extrusion. We present a new suite of computational models showing how the size and position of a weakened brittle zone within a dome can affect large-scale fracture formation, displacement, and the collapse mechanism. By combining recent laboratory data for the mechanical behavior of dome rocks with discrete element method models, we show (1) the presence of a weak zone increases instability, which is exacerbated when the size of the zone increases or the zone is positioned off-center; (2) the position of the weak zone changes the deformation mechanism from slumping-type slope deformation when the zone is positioned centrally, compared with deep-seated rotational slope failure when the zone is positioned toward the dome flank; and finally, (3) dome-cutting tensile fractures form in the presence of a small weak zone (60 m diameter, ∼14% of dome width), whereas large weak zones (120 m diameter, ∼27% of dome width) promote the formation of longer and deeper fractures that jeopardize larger dome volumes. Our results corroborate previous field observations at lava domes and indicate that large fracture formation, which greatly influences dome stability and outgassing, can be explained by the presence of concealed alteration zones. This improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for dome instability enables better hazard assessment at volcanoes worldwide.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/12/1346/616598/Large-scale-lava-dome-fracturing-as-a-result-of,2023-01-24
High-magnitude stresses induced by mineral-hydration reactions,"Fluid-rock interactions play a critical role in Earth’s lithosphere and environmental subsurface systems. In the absence of chemical mass transport, mineral-hydration reactions would be accompanied by a solid-volume increase that may induce differential stresses and associated reaction-induced deformation processes, such as dilatant fracturing to increase fluid permeability. However, the magnitudes of stresses that manifest in natural systems remain poorly constrained. We used optical and electron microscopy to show that one of the simplest hydration reactions in nature [MgO + H2O = Mg(OH)2] can induce stresses of several hundred megapascals, with local stresses of as much as ∼1.5 GPa. We demonstrate that these stresses not only cause fracturing but also induce plastic deformation with dislocation densities (1015 m−2) exceeding those typical of tectonically deformed rocks. If these reaction-induced stresses can be transmitted across larger length scales, they may influence the bulk stress state of reacting regions. Moreover, the structural damage induced may be the first step toward catastrophic rock failure, triggering crustal seismicity.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/12/1351/618286/High-magnitude-stresses-induced-by-mineral,2023-01-24
Fault surface morphology as an indicator for earthquake nucleation potential,"Laboratory measurements can determine the potential for geologic materials to generate unstable (seismic) slip, but a direct relation between sliding behavior in the laboratory and physical characteristics observable in the field is lacking, especially for the phyllosilicate-rich gouges that are widely observed in natural faults. We integrated laboratory friction experiments with surface topography microscopy and demonstrated a quantitative correlation between frictional slip behavior and fault surface morphology of centimeter-scale samples. Our results show that striated, smooth fault surfaces were formed in experiments that exhibited stable sliding, whereas potentially unstable sliding was associated with rougher, isotropic fault surfaces. We interpret that frictional stability and fault surface morphology are linked via the evolution of asperity contacts on localized slip surfaces. If fault surface roughness obeys a fractal relationship over a large range of length scales, then we infer that the morphological characteristics observed in the laboratory could indicate the earthquake nucleation potential on natural fault surfaces.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/12/1356/618283/Fault-surface-morphology-as-an-indicator-for,2023-01-24

Dominant precessional forcing of the East Asian summer monsoon since 260 ka,"One of the most perplexing problems in paleoclimate research is how orbital cyclicities force East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation variation over the middle to late Quaternary. Chinese loess records suggest that EASM precipitation was dominated by 100 k.y. cycles controlled by Northern Hemisphere ice sheet forcing. In contrast, speleothem records suggest that EASM precipitation was dominated by 23 k.y. cycles caused by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation forcing. In order to resolve this inconsistency, we present high-resolution paleoclimate records from Xijin drill cores on the western Chinese Loess Plateau for the past 260 k.y., the rough upper limit of luminescence dating. Magnetic susceptibility (χ) shows clear 23 k.y. precessional cycles over interglacials but has constant low values over glacials. This is interpreted as indicating a lack of pedogenesis, such that χ cannot record EASM precipitation variations, rather than an absence of EASM variation itself. To circumvent this issue, we use inversed sand content as an alternative proxy for EASM precipitation over glacials and splice this with the interglacial logarithmic χ from Xijin drill cores. This new record reveals dominant 23 k.y. cycles over both interglacials and glacials, consistent with speleothem δ18O data and dominant insolation forcing. These findings allow a consistent understanding of EASM variability and forcing mechanisms from both loess and speleothem archives, resolving one of the largest debates in past monsoon research. These results challenge suggestions of high-latitude ice sheet forcing of the EASM based on slowly accumulated loess records from the central Loess Plateau.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/12/1372/618210/Dominant-precessional-forcing-of-the-East-Asian,2023-01-24

"When knickzones limit upstream transmission of base-level fall: An example from Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i","A threshold drainage area limits fluvial transmission of base-level fall and may be expressed in the form of a waterfall or a series of waterfalls, defined here as a knickzone. Knickzones on the west coast of Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i (USA), exhibit evidence of a threshold drainage area. Eighteen (18) of the 25 knickzones in our study area are located at the coast or a tributary junction, have a drainage area <1.5 km2, and have been stationary for at least 1.5 m.y. The other seven knickzones are located >1 km upstream from the coast or nearest tributary junction and range in drainage area from 1 to 5.5 km2. Both sets of knickzones limit incision relative to canyons without knickzones. Field observations show strong ‘a‘ā flows and dikes always crop out at the lip of knickzones, suggesting these resistant rocks and coarse sediment generated from them act to inhibit knickzone migration. A model incorporating flood records and channel conditions above knickzones shows thresholds of coarse sediment entrainment are never exceeded below 1 km2. Our results demonstrate knickzones on the west coast of Kaua‘i are enduring features explained by resistant lava flows and physical limits in bedrock incision.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/12/1382/618175/When-knickzones-limit-upstream-transmission-of,2023-01-24

Reworked pollen reduces apparent floral change during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,"Plant megafossils from the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) in the Bighorn Basin, north-central Wyoming, USA, document a dramatic shift in floral composition, whereas palynofloral change from the same sections has appeared to be more subtle. We investigated this discrepancy by quantifying pollen preservation and measuring the stable carbon isotope composition of specific pollen taxa. Pollen grains belonging to two common latest Paleocene taxa are poorly preserved in PETM samples, and their δ13Cpollen is similar during the latest Paleocene and PETM. In contrast, pollen grains of a thermophilic taxon that became more abundant during the PETM are pristine, and the δ13Cpollen of PETM specimens is ∼4‰ lower than that of latest Paleocene specimens. More broadly, pollen grains belonging to lineages currently centered in temperate climates are poorly preserved when found in PETM samples, whereas in the same samples, pollen belonging to lineages now centered in the tropics are well preserved. These differences in preservation and isotopic composition indicate extensive redeposition of older pollen grains during the PETM. Increased abundance of Cretaceous palynotaxa in PETM samples confirms erosion and redeposition, likely resulting from more episodic and intense precipitation. Exclusion of reworked palynotaxa from analyses reveals that, as in the megaflora, temperate taxa were absent during the PETM at the time when dry tropical taxa briefly appeared. Major climate changes like the PETM may commonly destabilize landscapes, increase reworking, and thus smooth patterns of change in microfloras, leading to underestimates of the rate and magnitude of floral response to past global change.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/12/1398/618213/Reworked-pollen-reduces-apparent-floral-change,2023-01-24

Lagoon infilling by coral reef sand aprons as a proxy for carbonate sediment productivity,"Sand aprons are distinctive landforms that offer important insights into sedimentary dynamics for reef platform development. Here we link temporal and spatial scales of 21 sand aprons in the southern Great Barrier Reef to understand their Holocene formation and evolution in response to relative sea-level changes, the depth of the Pleistocene base, and contemporary morphodynamics. Our results show that lagoon infilling is a function of reef size and is a self-limiting process controlled by hydrodynamics and relative sea-level changes. Lagoon infilling does not depend on the type of reef or degree of exposure to waves, but it could reflect past wave climates. Our carbonate productivity estimates based on lagoon infilling are remarkably similar to those inferred from habitat classification. Finally, we hypothesize that current carbonate productivity has slowed because of the effects of climate change.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/50/12/1427/618176/Lagoon-infilling-by-coral-reef-sand-aprons-as-a,2023-01-24

Fuzzy Unsteady-State Drainage Solution for Land Reclamation,"Very well-drained lands could have a positive impact in various soil health indicators such as soil erosion and soil texture. A drainage system is responsible for properly aerated soil. Until today, in order to design a drainage system, a big challenge remained to find the subsurface drain spacing because many of the soil and hydraulic parameters present significant uncertainties. This fact also creates uncertainties to the overall physical problem solution, which, if not included in the preliminary design studies and calculations, could have bad consequences for the cultivated lands and soils. Finding the drain spacing requires the knowledge of the unsteady groundwater movement, which is described by the linear Boussinesq equation (Glover-Dumm equation). In this paper, the Adomian solution to the second order unsteady linear fuzzy partial differential one-dimensional Boussinesq equation is presented. The physical problem concerns unsteady drain spacing in a semi-infinite unconfined aquifer. The boundary conditions, with an initially horizontal water table, are considered fuzzy and the overall problem is translated to a system of crisp boundary value problems. Consequently, the crisp problem is solved using an Adomian decomposition method (ADM) and useful practical results are presented. In addition, by application of the possibility theory, the fuzzy results are translated into a crisp space, enabling the decision maker to make correct decisions about both the drain spacing and the future soil health management practices, with a reliable degree of confidence.",https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5338/10/2/34,2023-01-25
SPEI and multi-threshold run theory based drought analysis using multi-source products in China,"With the accelerated climate change, the selection of globe-warming related drought monitoring tools is vitally significant. To select the most suitable multi-source precipitation product for drought monitoring, this study comprehensively evaluated the performance of 7 latest version of multi-source precipitation estimate products (MPEs, including PERSIANN-CDR, CHIRPS, ERA5, MERRA2, APHRODITE, GPCC and MSWEP) and compared their drought monitoring applicability combined with GLEAM potential evapotranspiration (ETP) product based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) during 1983–2015 over China. The SPEI estimated by the China monthly Precipitation Analysis Product (CPAP) was used as the reference to assess their performance. In addition, the drought area ratio, frequency, duration and intensity were analyzed based on the multi-threshold run theory. The results showed that: (1) The precision of MPEs was higher in eastern China but lower in western China, and the overall accuracy of MPEs summarized as 4 levels from top to end respectively was GPCC and APHRODITE, MERRA2 and MSWEP, CHIRPS and PERSIANN-CDR as well as ERA5. GLEAM ETP performed well in eastern China but poor in western China with large underestimations. (2) The applicability of MPEs in drought monitoring was regional-specific (low in parts of Northwest Desert and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but high in other areas). The accuracy of estimated SPEI for most MPEs dropped with expanding timescale in most sub-regions. Among of MPEs, GPCC product comprehensively performed best in drought monitoring. (3) Drought events occurring in northern China were usually with larger area ratio, lower frequency and longer duration than other regions. Drought events had an exacerbating trend in southeastern China. Overall, this study provides significant information to choose suitable datasets for globe-warming related drought studies.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422013075,2023-01-25
Evidence for increasing influence of atmospheric teleconnections on water levels in the Great Lakes,"Understanding the variability and predominant drivers of water level fluctuations in large water bodies is critical for the development of proactive mitigation plans in the nearshore zone. Here, for the first time, we reconstructed the individual and collective influence of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, region 3.4 of El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation on Lake Huron-Michigan’s water budget components, including water levels, over-lake precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and river flow rates over a 115-year period. Conducting wavelet spectral analysis on the reconstructed impact of large-scale climate oscillations revealed the emergence of quasi-periodic and non-stationary fluctuations along with frequency shifts in hydrological variables, highlighting their increasingly stronger signature on water levels after 1980. After removing the atmospheric teleconnection effects, the residual hydrological time series provided evidence of gradual changes in runoff and river flow rates and their relationships with precipitation, reflecting the effects of intensifying anthropogenic activities on the regional water cycle over the past decades. Considering the uncertainty pertaining to the magnitude and frequency of atmospheric teleconnections in a changing climate, the findings of our study can offer a new perspective in our understanding of the drivers of water level variability along the shoreline and/or the navigability of shallow waters in the Great Lakes.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422012252,2023-01-25
Non-equilibrium solute transport in dipole flow tracer test (DFTT) considering the mixing effect in the wellbore,"Dipole flow tracer test (DFTT) has been proposed to estimate the vertical distribution of hydrogeological parameters by fitting the simulated and observed breakthrough curves (BTCs) in the extraction chamber of a vertical circulation well (VCW). Previous studies of DFTT models neglected the non-equilibrium sorption of tracer and the mixing process in the wellbore, which have been proved to strongly influence the estimation accuracy of the DFTT. In this study, we developed an improved DFTT model considering a two-site non-equilibrium sorption of the tracer as well as the impact of the mixing effects on the BTC behavior in both the extraction and injection chambers. The results indicate that when interpreting the DFTT with commonly-used organic tracers, an overestimation and underestimation occurs, especially when the models do not account for sorption and consider equilibrium sorption, respectively. In addition, the mixing effect was observed to affect the transport process as well as the BTC behaviors in the DFTT, leading to an overestimation of the dispersivity. The improved model proposed in this work was used to interpret the DFTT test conducted with Rhodamine WT (RWT) at the Lizzie Field Site, North Carolina. Results showed that the improved model had better performance in interpreting the DFTT compared to the stream tube model proposed by Sutton et al. (2000). This is especially when fluorescent dyes such as RWT or Rhodamine B are used as tracers. Furthermore, unlike previous models, the improved DFTT model is not limited as it is fit for tracers with various types of sorption properties. Meanwhile, the consideration for mixing effect in the wellbore, characterized by an ordinary differential equation, promotes the DFTT interpretation accuracy and also has great potential in the simulation of in situ remediation of subsurface contaminants through VCW, especially for in-well bioreactor technology.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422013221,2023-01-25
Drivers of spatiotemporal patterns of surface water inputs in a catchment at the rain-snow transition zone of the water-limited western United States,"Spatial and temporal dynamics of rainfall and snowmelt (i.e., surface water inputs, SWI) control soil moisture, groundwater recharge, and streamflow at annual, seasonal, and event scales. In the rain-snow transition zone, comprising a large portion of the mountainous western United States, there is limited understanding of the sensitivity of spatiotemporal SWI dynamics across hydrologically variable water years (WYs). We modeled rainfall and snowpack dynamics in a small headwater catchment (1.8 km2) spanning the rain-snow transition in southwestern Idaho, USA, for two hydrologically distinct WYs (2011 and 2014). In wet WY 2011 and dry WY 2014, total precipitation drove spatial variability in annual SWI. Snow drifts generated more SWI (901–2080 mm) than high-elevation scour zones (442–640 mm), which generated less SWI than mid-elevation, non-drift locations (452–784 mm). Seasonally, energy fluxes differed most during the snowmelt period, where higher net radiation at lower elevations and south-facing slopes drove SWI production. At the rain-on-snow (ROS) event scale, higher elevations and north-facing slopes generated 15–20 % of annual SWI, due mainly to higher turbulent fluxes. The most productive ROS events occurred after peak snow water equivalent (SWE), when rainfall fell onto ripe snowpacks. Snow drift locations were less susceptible to melt during ROS events, offset by the larger cold content and snowpack mass. Thus, catchment water resources depend on SWI magnitude, location, and timing, which are moderated by drift persistence at all temporal scales. As the climate warms, shifts in spatiotemporal SWI distribution are expected with declines in snowfall and snowfall redistribution in this area.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169422012690,2023-01-25
Characterisation of intertidal springs in a faulted multi-aquifer setting,"In intertidal zones, groundwater is often present as seepage that provides freshwater and nutrients to marine ecosystems. Point discharge or springs in intertidal zones have been observed in many locations, often in the form of sand boils. The spatial extent, temporal variability and source of intertidal springs are rarely documented and typically, not well understood. This study examined four intertidal groundwater springs at Sellicks Beach, South Australia, during May 2017, November 2019 and September 2020 using a combination of hydrogeophysical methods. A thermal infrared survey undertaken in 2017 showed springs as groupings of closely spaced sand boils that were warmer (15 °C) than the surrounding saturated beach sediments (7 °C). The four springs ranged in diameter from 0.20 to 0.45 m. Electromagnetic geophysical surveys identified a resistive anomaly (3.5 to 5.0 ohm.m), assumed to represent freshwater upwelling at the location of a spring, that extended 10 m horizontally and at least 6.7 m vertically. The average electrical conductivity of water discharging from the springs was 18.4 mS/cm, while seawater was 54.8 mS/cm. δ18O and δ2H data from the springs showed a variation between winter and spring, likely caused by variations in mixing ratios between seawater and groundwater. The springs are proximal to major regional fault systems that likely create preferential flow paths that control spring location and flow rates. The observations of spring characteristics highlight the critical role of seawater-groundwater mixing ratios, preferential flow paths and tidal variations in creating temporal variability in spring discharge and salinity.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422010277,2023-01-25
"Forest hydrology in Chile: Past, present, and future","This paper reviews the current knowledge of hydrological processes in Chilean temperate forests which extend along western South America from latitude 29° S to 56° S. This geographic region includes a diverse range of natural and planted forests and a broad sweep of vegetation, edaphic, topographic, geologic, and climatic settings which create a unique natural laboratory. Many local communities, endangered freshwater ecosystems, and downstream economic activities in Chile rely on water flows from forested catchments. This review aims to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of Chilean forest hydrology, to (ii) review prior research in forest hydrology in Chile, and to (iii) identify knowledge gaps and provide a vision for future research on forest hydrology in Chile. We reviewed the relation between native forests, commercial plantations, and other land uses on water yield and water quality from the plot to the catchment scale. Much of the global understanding of forests and their relationship with the water cycle is in line with the findings of the studies reviewed here. Streamflow from forested catchments increases after timber harvesting, native forests appear to use less water than plantations, and streams draining native forest yield less sediment than streams draining plantations or grassland/shrublands. We identified 20 key knowledge gaps such as forest groundwater systems, soil–plant-atmosphere interactions, native forest hydrology, and the effect of forest management and restoration on hydrology. Also, we found a paucity of research in the northern geographic areas and forest types (35-36°S); most forest hydrology studies in Chile (56%) have been conducted in the southern area (Los Rios Region around 39-40° S). There is limited knowledge of the geology and soils in many forested areas and how surface and groundwater are affected by changes in land cover. There is an opportunity to advance our understanding using process-based investigations linking field studies and modeling. Through the establishment of a forest hydrology science “society” to coordinate efforts, regional and national-scale land use planning might be supported. Our review ends with a vision to advance a cross-scale collaborative effort to use new nation-wide catchment-scale networks Long-term Ecosystem Research (LTER) sites, to promote common and complementary techniques in these studies, and to conduct transdisciplinary research to advance sound and integrated planning of forest lands in Chile.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169422012513,2023-01-25
How does dewfall affect drought assessment in different climate regions in China,"Dewfall is an important source of additional precipitation, but it is frequently ignored in water balance calculations. In this study, the dewfall of 523 weather stations in China was calculated. An improved drought index SPI-cor was proposed by substituting the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation by the SPI calculation method, where dewfall was calculated by the Penman-Monteith equation with the GLDAS-2 data. The temporal and spatial distributions characteristics of dewfall were discussed, and the spatial applicability of SPI and SPI-cor was determined. The results indicated that the dewfall formation is periodic, with more than 60% of the dewfall occurring between April and August. The amount of dewfall is lower than that of precipitation. The dewfall in China has a distribution pattern of high dewfall in the northeast and northwest but low dewfall in the center and south. The proportion of dewfall in precipitation increases from south to north with the exception of northwestern China. Comparing of SPI to SPI-cor, the influence of dewfall in arid, semi-arid, sub-humid and humid areas declines in turn in accordance with the proportion of dewfall in precipitation of the four regions and is opposite to the correlation coefficients of SPI and SPI-cor. Dewfall has an average impact of one drought grade on the assessment of drought as long as it works. With the performance of SPI and SPI-cor at different weather stations, historical drought events, and vegetation response to drought, SPI is better in northeastern China and eastern Inner Mongolia, while SPI-cor is more applicable in central and northwestern China; the difference between SPI and SPI-cor drought grades are not noticeable in southern China. Therefore, adopting SPI and SPI-cor to evaluate drought in different regions can help to make more accurate drought assessment.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422011714,2023-01-25
Comparison and interpretation of data-driven models for simulating site-specific human-impacted groundwater dynamics in the North China Plain,"Data-driven models (DDMs) have gained increasing popularity in groundwater hydrology in recent years due to the advancement of machine learning algorithms and the flexibility of easily accessible data. For groundwater purposes, the differences in deep learning (DL) algorithms compared with traditional tree-based machine learning (TB) algorithms have not been fully investigated, and the importance of different input features for groundwater level simulation has rarely been addressed. In this study, we test and validate six DDMs for simulating the groundwater levels of the North China Plain (NCP) at selected boreholes. The NCP is a large alluvial aquifer system (144,000 km2) overexploited by massive water withdrawals since the 1960s. In our simulations, four DDMs were tree-based (random forest, XGBoost, gradient boosting regression, LightGBM), and two were deep learning algorithms (Vanilla-LSTM and encoder-decoder-LSTM). The results showed that deep-learning-based DDMs provided a better correlation to observed data than tree-based models. Additionally, encoder-decoder-LSTM had the best model performance among all DDMs, and it had the ability to generate compelling results (R2 = 0.61, RMSE = 0.73 m), although each individual driving factor had a low correlation to the simulation target. GINI coefficient analysis and permutation feature importance analysis were used to determine the ranking of different model driving factors for the interpretable results. The results showed that the factors related to human activities had a much stronger impact on groundwater level variation than other factors. A preprocessing procedure of the driving factors helps produce satisfactory simulations aimed at sustainable water management and aquifer restoration, especially in data-scarce areas.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002216942201321X,2023-01-25
Water consumption during a leafless period in a dry season in three deciduous tropical timber species,"Besides mechanical protection and sugar transport through phloem, barks also transpire some amount of water. Bark transpiration may be a driving force to keep water flux during the leafless period among tropical deciduous trees, but has been hardly investigated. In the current investigation we used the sap flow data to assess the water consumption during leaf loss initiation, total leaf loss period, and leaf flush period in three economically important tropical deciduous timber species i.e, Anogeissus acuminata, Dipterocarpus tuberculatus and Tectona grandis. Eight trees of each species were measured using Granier’s heat dissipation sensors, with the circumference ranging from 59 cm to 172 cm (mean 59.84 cm) across the three species. The phenological observation for canopy leaves was also carried out on weekly basis. During the completely leafless period, a significant amount of water flux was detected in all three species, which was correlated with vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and light intensity. The whole tree daily mean water consumption during this leaf-less, flower-less and fruit-less period, mainly due to bark transpiration was around 8–14 kg across the three species. It was about 7 to 18 % of the mean whole-tree daily transpiration in the fully foliated canopies during a typical wet-season period. This water flux was supported by sufficient soil moisture as indicated by the pre-dawn leaf water potential higher than –0.4 MPa in the three species. Further, a significant and positive relationship (R2 = 0.32, P < 0.005) was found between tree circumference and whole-tree water consumption during the leaf-less period. The total stand-level water consumption during the leaf-less period ranged from 13 mm to 26.8 mm on a 30 days basis across the three species. Such water flux mainly driven by bark transpiration could have a significant role in maintaining the hydraulic integrity of trees in the dry season, although it could reduce xylem water potential to a risky level of hydraulic dysfunction during a prolonged drought or on dry sites. The study is the first report on bark transpiration in intact trees, scaled to the stand-level, which should be included in the modeling of hydraulic function of plant and ecosystem hydrology.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422012756,2023-01-25
Turning points in the impact of earlier green-up on evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity in a semi-arid grassland watershed,"Warming-induced shifts in vegetation phenology affect ecosystem functions and the hydrological cycle. Research has so far focused on phenological trends, drivers and feedback across temperate and tropical forests, while their impacts on carbon assimilation and hydrological processes in temperate semi-arid grasslands remain poorly understood. Based on remote-sensing datasets from the Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS), we examined the trends in vegetation phenology, gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) in the Chabagou watershed of the Loess Plateau, China, for 2001–2020. The results revealed that the start of the growing season (SOS) had advanced significantly between 2001 and 2020, at an average rate of –1.47 days yr−1 (p < 0.05), while the end of the growing season (EOS) had delayed non-significantly by about 0.04 days yr−1. SOS robustly regulated growing season length (GSL), which was extended by an average rate of 1.60 days yr−1. Regression analysis between phenology and two main climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) reveals that precipitation is the main climatic factor affecting SOS, while temperature plays a relatively important role in EOS delay in the study area. Consistent with the phenological trend, annual ET and GPP increased steadily from 2001 to 2020. Based on the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), we further investigated the net effects of phenological change on carbon and water fluxes. The simulation results indicated that, for our study site, the correlation between SOS and summer ET would transform from positive to negative once SOS had advanced to around 129 days of the year (DOY) (and 125 DOY for summer GPP). Summer ET and GPP increased as SOS advanced (and GSL extended) until the SOS reached the turning points, and decreased if the SOS (and GSL) advanced beyond the turning points. The mechanism of variations in water and carbon fluxes responding to phenology dynamics could be more complex than we acknowledged to date because the climate is now approaching turning points. We, therefore, suggest improving the dynamic phenologic models for better predicting trends of ecosystem carbon gain and water loss with ongoing climate change.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422013257,2023-01-25
Two-dimensional convolutional neural network outperforms other machine learning architectures for water depth surrogate modeling,"Rapid prediction of spatially distributed hydrological variables, such as water depths in rivers, is an important but challenging task. This study proposes a novel matrix-based deep learning approach for predicting spatial distribution of water depths in rivers. The proposed approach was constructed based on a two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network (CNN) with a new architecture that was specifically designed for providing spatial distribution maps. A numerical dataset was established based on a field cruise and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling for different scenarios, and numerical experiments were designed to predict spatial distribution of water depths for different scenarios using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM), genetic programming (GP), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN), and the proposed CNN algorithms. The results showed that the proposed CNN approach captured both the large-scale and small-scale spatial patterns remarkably well, and it outperformed the other approaches. This study shows that the 2D CNN algorithm is better than the classical machine learning (ML) algorithms for inundation modeling. The proposed approach is thus a promising tool for providing rapid predictions of spatial distribution of water depths in river systems and can potentially be leveraged to predict other spatially distributed hydrological variables.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422013828,2023-01-25
Plum rain enhances porewater greenhouse gas fluxes and weakens the acidification buffering potential in saltmarshes,"Seasonal rainfall, locally known as plum rain, is a potentially important driver of greenhouse gas dynamics in saltmarshes, but no studies of its effects have been reported. We quantified porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes in a saltmarsh over a spring-neap-spring tidal cycle (30 tidal cycles) during the plum rain season. Radon-traced porewater exchange rates were found to be 15.5 (pre-rain) and 24.8 (plum rain) cm day−1, which released CO2 and CH4 to surface waters with the fluxes (mmol m−2 day−1) of 77.7 and 0.28 during the pre-rain period and 132.3 and 0.63 over the plum rain period, respectively. The large amounts of soil CO2 export through porewater exchange during the plum rain significantly increased the CO2 inventory and reduced the pH from 8.06 to 7.86 (median) in saltmarsh surface water. The result suggests that plum rain-derived porewater exchange with lower pH values may contribute to coastal acidification.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422012562,2023-01-25
Incorporating non-stationarity from climate change into rainfall frequency and intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves,"Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves – sometimes also called precipitation frequency estimates – are used to design urban drainage systems for stormwater control and, when combined with hydrologic modeling, to design flood control infrastructure and other structures. However, common approaches to estimating IDF curves need to be revised to account for non-stationarity from global climate change. This review synthesizes the current knowledge and on-going research regarding IDF curves under non-stationarity. In particular, this review briefly summarizes known and projected changes in extreme precipitation at the global scale, describes approaches for IDF curve estimation under non-stationarity (focusing on the covariate-based approach and including a brief overview of the specific challenges facing snow-dominated regions), addresses the topic of regionalization under non-stationarity (which has been overlooked in previous reviews), explores the challenges of design values and uncertainty in the context of non-stationarity, provides details on these topics in the context of the United States, and finishes by enumerating needed avenues of future research.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422013270,2023-01-25
Mechanisms of bar adjustments in the Jingjiang Reach of the Yangtze River in response to the operation of the Three Gorges Dam,"Dams alter downstream river flow and sediment regimes, causing significant changes in river morphologies. The middle Yangtze River downstream of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has experienced rapid erosion in recent years, and the associated morphodynamic changes have negatively impacted the riverbank stability, navigation waterways and ecological functioning. Earlier studies have analyzed recent channel adjustments in the Yangtze River; however, our understanding of changes in the bar morphodynamics remains incomplete. In this study, we collected and analyzed flow and sediment data (1991–2016) and river bathymetry data (1975–2017) and investigated the mechanisms of bar adjustments along the Jingjiang Reach in the post-TGD period. The results indicate that most steady bars with a higher elevation and better vegetation coverage have experienced lateral erosion, while their elevations have remained stable overall. The unvegetated migrating bars with a lower elevation have experienced severe surficial erosion and area shrinkages. A new assessment method of the dominant discharge range on downstream bars is provided after dam closure. The dominant discharge range that determines bar adjustments corresponds to the flow stages between the submersion of migrating bars (∼12,500 m3/s) and the overtopping of vegetated steady bars (∼27,500 m3/s) in the Jingjiang Reach. A quantitative relationship exists between bar erosion in response to changed dominant discharge regimes and sediment decline. The significant bar erosion after the operation of the TGD can be attributed to the increased flow duration and the sharp decline in the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) of the dominant discharge range, and changes in SSCs play a primary role. The bar area will decrease by ∼0.003 km2 when the annual cumulative duration of the dominant discharge increases by one day and by ∼0.234 km2 when the annual average SSC of the dominant discharge decreases by 0.01 kg/m3. Furthermore, vegetation encroachment and colonization play a positive role in stabilizing bar morphologies and limiting surficial erosion, whereas vegetation soley cannot prevent the lateral erosion of steady bars. These findings suggest that multiple controls of discharge, sediment and vegetation on the evolution of fluvial bars and have important implications for river management and ecological evaluation in response to the operation of large dams.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422013725,2023-01-25
A generalized reservoir module for SWAT applications in watersheds regulated by reservoirs,"Accurate estimates of reservoir outflow are important for simulating runoff of watersheds regulated by large reservoirs using hydrological models. The target release reservoir module widely used in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) shows poor performance in simulating the outflow and water level of large multipurpose reservoirs. In this study, a generalized reservoir operation chart-based reservoir module is developed as an alternative to the original reservoir module in SWAT (SWAT-Or). The proposed reservoir module includes a dynamic decision-based outflow framework integrated into the operation chart. The modified version of SWAT with the new reservoir module (SWAT-M) is not only suite for small reservoir with flood control function but also more applicable to large multipurpose reservoir. The predictions obtained from the original and new reservoir modules are compared with measured data from the three largest reservoirs in the Dongjiang River basin, South China. The performance of SWAT-M and SWAT-OR for daily and monthly runoff simulations of four hydrological stations in the basin are compared. The results shows that the proposed module produces results closer to the field measurements and has fewer errors than the original module, which predicts inappropriate low reservoir outflow during dry periods. In addition, the runoff simulation by SWAT-M shows a significant improvement, in particular for stations directly influenced by large reservoirs. The monthly (daily) scale  of SWAT-M is 0.02 to 0.21 (0.14 to 0.44) higher, and the  is 0.11 to 0.30 (0.12 to 7.16) higher than that of SWAT-Or. The proposed reservoir operation chart-based module significantly improves the applicability of SWAT to simulate runoff in watersheds regulated by large reservoirs.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422013403,2023-01-25
Evaluation of statistical models: Perspective of water quality load estimation,"The accurate representation of the load of water quality constituents, transported by rivers and streams, is crucial to understand the impact on the quality of the lakes, the behavior of the rivers and streams. Statistical models have been developed to predict the water-quality constituent loads from the available data of sampled concentration (low-frequency/grab chemistry data) and continuous discharge (high frequency) at a particular sampled location and to further analyze trends and changes in water quality. However, the performance of statistical models to estimate water quality constituent loads depends on many aspects including the type of water quality constituent, sampling strategy and frequency, and the land use and areas of the watershed. This study evaluates the performance of a wide range of statistical models for the estimation of total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) loads under various sampling scenarios and monitoring stations in Southern Ontario, Canada. Trends in TSS and TP concentrations and loads were further analyzed in major tributaries. The Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season Kalman Filter (WRTDS_K) model was found to be the most suitable model (p > 0.05 and Percentage Difference (%) (PDIFF) between ±20) for predicting TSS loads at most sampling stations and under most sampling scenarios, while, the Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) model was found to be the most suitable model (p > 0.05 and flux bias statistics (FBS) between ±0.1) for predicting TP loads. The applied statistical models (LOADEST simple and curvilinear models, WRTDS, WRTDS_k, Beale’s estimator, composite and interpolation models) have shown a limited potential to estimate load accurately at monitoring stations covering small drainage areas.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169422012914,2023-01-25
